190,"Oriental, Pallid, Brush and Black-eared Cuckoos",Black-eared Cuckoo,Chrysococcyx osculans,19-21cm,"usually quiet, but in breeding season males call from a prominent open perch, giving a piercing, drawn out, slightly descending whistle repeated at regular intervals, each call of the same length and each at the same penetrating high pitch as the previous: ""feeeieuw, feeeieuw, feeeiew"". Also a loud but less piercing ""fee-ew-it, fee-ew-it"" or ""fee-ew-eer"". Occasionally an abrupt, quieter ""feeit"".",

192,"Chestnut-breasted, Fan-tailed and Bronze Cuckoos",Fan-tailed Cuckoo,Cacomantis flabelliformis,25-27cm,"a descending, rattling, mellow, musical trill, quite loud if close; similar to trill of Chestnut-reasted, which undulates rather than descends, and may be slightly sharper.

The sequence of perhaps five to ten calls starts with slow calls with long pauses of several seconds between, but gradually becomes quicker and higher. Also has a similar sequence but more rapid; begins quite deep and mellow yet with a resonant, ringing quality; the calls come quicker, the series rising ""quowil-quoil-quoil-quoi-quoi"".",
194,"Koel, Channel-Bbilled Cuckoo, Coucal",Channel-billed Cuckoo,Scythrops novaehollandiae,58-65cm,"loud, raucous, maniacal crowing and squawking: ""awrrk, aworrk, oirrk, oik-oik-oik"" with many variations -- ""aiirrk-aiirrk-ark-ark-urk"" and crow-like ""arrk, arrk, arrk, airrk, urrgk urrgk"".",
194,"Koel, Channel-Bbilled Cuckoo, Coucal",Pheasant Coucal,Centropus phqsianinus,60-75cm,"a long, rapid series of resonant notes; initially slow, accelerating, slowing and falling away, or, at other times, beginning abruptly, rapid notes sustained, then falling away: ""coop, coop, cook-kook-kook-kook…"". Sometimes accompanied by a second bird at different pitch. Also a metallic, tapping ""chak-chak-chok, chok, chowk, chowgk"".",
196,Hawk Owls,Rufous Owl,Ninox rufa,45-55cm,"usually a slow, deep ""whooo-hoo""; the first ""whoo"" drawn out the second note shorter, same or slightly lower pitch. Also, low moaning sounds. When both sexes call, male's hoots slightly deeper; courting male may give up to seven rapid hoots.",
196,Hawk Owls,Powerful Owl,Ninox strenua,60-65cm,"in breeding season, male's territorial call is a clear, almost ringing, far carrying single or double ""whoo""; begins softly and rises clear and loud; may be heard a kilometre away. When a pair is calling, the male's call is deeper; female's higher hooting seems to be a response or contact call. Various totally different sounds are given near the nest hollow.",
196,Hawk Owls,Brown Hawk-Owl,Ninox scutulata,29-30cm,"mellow, double noted, whistled ""cooo-hoo"", the second note higher, shorter.",
196,Hawk Owls,Barking Owl,Ninox Connivens,36-45cm,"a rapid ""wook-wook"", clear and very carrying; pleasant and rather musical, especially when a pair is calling, the male slightly deeper, the female responding with slightly higher, clearer notes. Close by, a soft, gruff ""arr"" may be heard, leading in to the loud, clear barks, becoming ""arr-wook-wook"". At times there is a brief flurry of calls, a fast, excited, higher ""wook-wook,-wook-wook-""; at other times the calls die away to a soft, low, relaxed ""wuf-wuf, wuf-wuf"". Also, rarely, perhaps only at the beginning of the breeding season, a chilling ""screaming woman"" call, a long, wavering ""a-aii-eer-lp"".",
196,Hawk Owls,Southern Boobook,Ninox novaseelandiae,25-35cm,"a mellow, musical, double hoot, ""ook-kook"" or ""book-book"" at varied pitch; the second note is lower, throaty and vibrarting in the deepest calls. The sound carries far and may be repeated monotonously; often a pair, calling back and forth in duet, add diversity and excitement to this call -- slow then rapid, with variations from low and tremulous to high and clear, or a deep, throaty, rapid, vibrating ""quorre-quorrr-quorrr"" and a high, tremulous, descending whistle.",
198,Barn Owls,Barn Owl,Tyto alba,30-40cm,"a husky, often wavering screech, ""skeeaiirr"", often while in flight and more often in breeding season.",
198,Barn Owls,Masked Owl,Tyto novaehollandiae,35-57cm,"drawn out, harsh, unwavering screech, stronger and deeper than that of Barn Owl; also cackling, rattling shrieks, raspings.",
198,Barn Owls,Grass Owl,Tyto capnsis,32-38cm,"a harsh, rasping screech similar to that of Barn Owl and low, soft screeches, trills.",
198,Barn Owls,Lesser Sooty Owl,Tyto multipunctata,30-38cm,"a piercing, downwards whistle or shriek.",
198,Barn Owls,Sooty Owl,Tyto tenebricosa,40-50cm,"contact call, often given in flight, is a long, descending, vibrating screech; from a distance sounds more whistle than screech.Other screeches are of almost uniform rather than descending pitch, similar to the Barn Owl's screech, but far louder, more powerful, harsh and metallic.",
200,Frogmouths,Tawny Frogmouth,Podargus strigoides,34-52cm,"a muffled, low, resonant, rapid ""ooo-oom-oom-oom""; from males, a similarly rapid ""ar-oom, aroom, aoom-aroom"".",
200,Frogmouths,Marbled Frogmouth,Podargus ocellatus,37-46cm,"usually a double noted, rapid, musical ""whooo-whoop, whooo-whoop"", the second part uplifted; a guttural, growling ""quorr-orr, quorr-orr"", which is deep, throaty, vibrating; a rapid, descending bubbling sound.",
200,Frogmouths,Papuan Frogmouth,Podargus papuensis,50-60cm,"soft, low, steady ""orrm-orrm-orrm-orrm"", descending sequence of bubbly sounds, often ending with a ""clak"", perhaps a snapping of the bill. Also a harsh, long, scolding, rasping scream: ""haaarrrrck!"". This screaming screech is often intermixed with the harshest, loudest and most unpleasant of frog-croak noises.",
202,Nightjars,Large-tailed Nightjar,Caprimulgus macrurus,25-28cm,"in distance, hollow ""quok-quok-quok-"" o ""chop-chop-chop-""; close at hand the call is a quick ""quorrok-quorrok-quorrok-"" -- usually three to six calls, brief pause, then repeat. Each ""quorrok"" is very abrupt. In the distance sounds more like ""quok"" or ""chop"".",
202,Nightjars,Spotted Nightjar,Eurostopodus argus,29-32cm,"a beautiful call that carries far on still nights in open country. Starts with slow notes, accelerates, becomes rapid and loud, then dies away in a long series of bubbling sounds: ""coooor, cawoor, cawow-caWOW-caWOW-tooka-tooka-tooka-tooka…"".",
202,Nightjars,White-throated Nightjar,Eurostopodus mystacalis,32-37cm,"attractive long sequence of musical, bubbling sounds; begins with very slow notes that become more rapid, rising to a crescendo, then abruptly switching to a long cascade of bubbling nots: ""awwk, awwk, awk, awk-Awk-AWkAWk-quok-quok-quok-quok-quok-"". This latter sound, given very rapidly, can be like the initial chuckle of a Lauughing Kookaburra before it launches into full raucous laughter, or like small, low-pitched motorcycle engine. Also has a sharp, penetrating ""aik!, aik!, aik!"".",
202, Nighjars,Australian Owlet-nightjar,Aegotheles cristatus,21-25cm,"a distinctive, pleasant churring, one of the most comon calls of the night in the Australian bush, especially in the arid interior where even the smallest stand of stunted trees seems to have its resident Owlet-nightjars. At a distance the call is a pleasant, vibrating, musical churring, ending slightly sharp. Closer, the churring is recognisable in the first, loudest part of the call, like a rolling of r's that gives a throaty ""quar-rr-rgh-"". It then blends to a higher, sharper, but not as loud, ""-a-kak"" -- the whole call an undulating ""quar-rr-rgh-a-kak, quar-rr-rgh-a-kak"". Also gives a single, sharp, penetrating, metallic ""aeiiirk!"". Calls throughout the year, and often in the day, when it may then be seen sitting, sunning, at the entrance to its hollow. Flushes easily; darts immediately to another hollow, seemingly familiar with all the hollows wthin its territory.",
204,"Swiftlets, Swifts, Needletail",Glossy Swiftlet,Collocalia esculenta,9-11.5cm,"silent, or weak, sharp twitter.",
204,"Swiftlets, Swifts, Needletail",White-rumped Swiftlet,Aerodramus spodiopygius,11-12cm,"high pitched twittering, squeaking; in caves, echolocation by metallic clicking.",
204,"Swiftlets, Swifts, Needletail",Uniform Swiftlet,Collocalia vanikorensis,11-12cm,"when flying low and close, scratchy, high twittering may be heard.",
204,"Swiftlets, Swifts, Needletail",House Swift,Apus affinis,13-14cm,"harsh, shrill, rippling or rattling trill; occasionally high, squeaky shrieks.",

206,River and Rainforest Kingfishers,Azure Kingfisher,Alcedo azurea,17-19cm,"often silent, but frequent sharp squeaking when breeding; the high, thin ""eeeet"" given in flight is easily audible if bird darts very close, but at any distance needs nearly perfect high-frequency hearing.",
206,River and Rainforest Kingfishers,Little Kingfisher,Alcedo pusilla,12-13cm,"extremely high-pitched squeak, ""tzeeet"" or ""szeeit"", often given in flight; sometimes a rapid, pipping ""tseet-tseet-tseet-tseet"". These calls are even higher-pitched and weaker than those of the Azure, and probably inaudible to many observers if the bird is not very close",
206,River and Rainforest Kingfishers,Buff-breasted Paradise-Kingfisher,Tanysiptera sylvia,30-35cm,"a rapid succession of notes, not high-pitched but rather metallic with a touch of harshness, resonates and carries far through the rainforest: ""karow-karow-karow-karow-"" or ""charow-tcharow"", the ""ow"" slightly uplifting, stronger, higher and emphasised. Each call is rapid, the usual series of six to ten calls taking only 3 or 4 seconds. It also gives a mellow, musical trill that begins strongly and continues for 3 or 4 seconds, fading away in pitch and volume. The alarm, if the nest is disturbed, is a high screech.",
206,River and Rainforest Kingfishers,Common Paradise-Kingfisher,Tanysiptera galatea,33-43cm,"mournful notes lead into a rapid, loud trill.",
208,Tree Kingfishers,Yellow-billed Kingfisher,Syma torotoro,18-20cm,"gives a loud, ringing, msuical trill, at first quite rapid, but rising steeply in pitch and tempo until it is a shrill, vibrating whistle, undulating, finally fading away to be repeated after a pause. Often given repeatedly with increasing intensity, especially when answered from an adjoining territory. Scolds and screeches when defending the nest site.",
208,Tree Kingfishers,Forest Kingfisher,Todiramphus macleayii,17-23cm,"sharp, piercing, very rapid ""kik-kik-kik-kikkikikikik-"" in long sequences; much faster rate than quite similar call of the Sacred Kingfisher.",
208,Tree Kingfishers,Red-backed Kingfisher,Todiramphus pyrrhopygia,20-24cm,"a mournful ""kee-ip"", the last ""-ip"" ending abruptly, given in a long, slow series at intervals of several seconds: ""kweee-ip, kweee-ip, kweee-ip"". Also uses a slightly deeper, nasal rather than clear, ""quaerirr-ip, quaeirr-ip"", which has an even more melancholic quality than the higher call.",
208,Tree Kingfishers,Collared Kingfisher,Todiramphus chloris,24-28cm,"calls like the Sacred, but slower, stronger, sharp and penetrating, at greater intervals: ""kik-, kik-, kik-"", perhaps closer to ""kiek"" than the quick ""kik"" of the Sacred; also a rattling, piercing ""kr-r-riek-kr-r-riek-"".",
208,Tree Kingfishers,Sacred Kingfisher,Todiramphus sanctus,20-23cm,"early in breeding season, a loud, sharp, penetrating, far-carrying ""kik-kik-kik-kik-"", usually of 3 to 5 notes, occasionally ""kek-kek-kek-kek""; these calls repeated almost incessantly through the day. Between a pair near the nest, a clear, shrill ""kieer-kieer-kieer-"", often when about to fly to nest or mate with food. On arrival, ""kek-krreee-krreee-kreee-kreee"", a vibrant, rising sound. In defending nest site, dives with loud harsh scream.",
210,"Kookaburras, Bee-eater, Dollarbird",Blue-winged Kookaburra,Dacelo leachii,38-42cm,"a raucous cacophony, begins slowly, builds louder: ""kok-kok-kok-QUOR-R-RORK-QUOR-R-RORK-QUOR-R-RORK-car-r-aark-craark-crak-qwok-quok"". One bird starts calling, followed by others in unsynchronised fashion, building up, rising and falling in cacophony.",
210,"Kookaburras, Bee-eater, Dollarbird",Laughing Kookaburra,Dacelo novaeguineae,40-47cm,"a far more pleasant, jovial ""laughter"" than that of the Blue-winged; merry chuckling rising to raucous laughter, fading away again to a slow throaty chuckle: ""chok, kok, kok, kak-KAK-KAK-KAK-KOK-KAK-KOK-kook-kook-kok, kok, kok"", often with other birds joining in, giving greater volume to the laughter. Also some low, grinding ""growk-growk"" noises.",
210,"Kookaburras, Bee-eater, Dollarbird",Rainbow Bee-eater,Merops ornatus,23-27cm,"a loud, clear, sharp, cheerily vibrating burst of ""pir-r-r"" calls is often given in flight, carrying far and attracting attention. Delivered with characteristic rapid rattling or vibrating; a few or very many calls in quick succession; these fluctuate slightly in pitch and volume: ""pirr-pirrrp-pirr-pirrr-pirrp-pirr-pirrr-pirr-pirrp-"".",
210,"Kookaburras, Bee-eater, Dollarbird",Dollarbird,Eurystomus orientalis,25-29cm,"usually a rapid cackle -- an abrupt, grinding, harsh, metallic, jarring, buzzing, rattle, ""kzak-kzak-kzak-kzak-kzak-kzak-"" or ""kak-kak-kak-"". Sometimes it gives similar, slightly slower, stronger ""kzaak!"" calls at wide erratic intervals. Other calls include a deeper, slower, growling ""kazarrk-"" and a higher raucous but not grating ""kraak-kriak-kraak"".","long list of adjectives: an abrupt, grinding, harsh, metallic, jarring, buzzing, rattle, ""kzak-kzak-kzak-kzak-kzak-kzak-"""
212,Pittas,Red-bellied Pitta,Pitta erythrogaster,17-19cm,"calls from ground and from forest canopy perches. The call is slow, drawn out and mournful, beginning so low that it is almost a growl, rising steadily in volume and pitch, mellow and tremulous at first, finishing quite high and clear. The second note follows at slightly lower pitch and volume, softer and more mellow, not tremulous; the whole call a long, slow ""gr-r-r-r-rork, groir""; may be enticed with call imitations.",
212,Pittas,Blue-winged Pitta,Pitta moluccensis,18-21cm,"the call is similar to that of the Noisy Pitta, but more husky, slightly lower and with different emphasis and timing. The double-noted call of the Noisy Pitta rises sharp and querulous at the end of the second note, seemingly delivered quite rapidly and cheerfully, but the call of the Blue-winged is a more uniform, scratchy ""quaraerk, quaraerk"" with a longer pause between notes and a barely discernible uplift in the second note. The calls have also been described as ""taew-laew"", ""pu-wipu, puwi-u"" and ""pu-wiu"". The Blue-winged Pitta also has a loud ""skieew!"" alarm call.",
212,Pittas,Noisy Pitta,Pita versicolor,18-20cm,"loud, brisk, ringing, metallic, double noted, mellow whistles, ""quarreek-quarrik, quarreek-quarrik"", commonly described as ""walk-to-work""; carries far in the rainforest. A single, harsh, mournful ""kieow"", sometimes given at night, may be a warning or alarm call.",
212,Pittas,Rainbow Pitta,Pitta iris,16-19cm,"clear, rather sharp, metallic. Differs from other Aust. Pittas in having a preliminary note, then the main call rapidly in three parts, a quieter ""kwe"", followed by a call similar to that of the Noisy, but somewhat sharper: ""kwe, kweeik-a-kweek"".",
214,Lyrebirds,Superb Lyrebird,Menura novaehollandiae,male 80-95cm; female 75-85cm,"powerful, far-carrying; can reproduce faithfully a huge range of calls from tiny, squeaky voiced birds to the harsh growlings of Gang-gang Cocaktaoos. The sounds of Eastern Whip-bird, Kookaburra, Rosella and the rasping churring of the Satin Bowerbird intermingles with the thin, high notes of the smallest thornbills and robins. These are intermixed with strange complex sounds of the Lyrebird's own creation, often mechanical, rattling, whirring in nature, and thudding noises. Sounds of saws and other machinery will be faithfully reproduced if heard in nearby forestry or farming activities.",
214,Lyrebirds,Albert's Lyrebird,Menura alberti,male 80-90cm; female 65-75cm,"both this species and the Superb have powerful, flexible voices and use a mixture of their own calls and mimicry of other species in long unbroken passages of song. But compared with the Superb, the Albert's Lyrebird restricts its mimicry to a few species. The voice can create sounds at one moment deep and resonant, switch to high thin squeaks and sharp trills, then change again to harsh noises. Some of the passages of song begin with a soft, mellow sound that rises clearer and louder, and which has been likened to the howl of a dingo. Males call many hours daily in the peak of the winter breeding season; quiet at other times. The Green Catbird and Satin Bowerird feature strongly in its imitations. In alarm gives a shrill shriek. Evn when calling strongly, this shy and elusive species is not easily sighted in the dense tangled vegetation of its habitat with dim light and the birds wary.",
216,"Scrub-birds, Bristlebirds",Rufous Scrub-bird,Atrichornis rufescens,17-19cm,"the powerful, ringing calls can be heard as rather harsh and metallic from far away; at close range they are extremely, almost painfully, loud -- a slow, deliberate ""cheip"" with the central ""ei"" strongly emphasised. Calls include a ""cheip, cheip, cheip, cheip"", a more abrupt,equally loud, ""chep-chep-chep-"", a sharper ""chwiep-chwiep-chwiep"" and a whip-cracked ""chweeip-chweeip-"". Other sounds are only audible at close range: soft mellow cheeps, trills, scoldings.",
216,"Scrub-birds, Bristlebirds",Noisy Scrub-bird,Atrichornis clamosus,21-23cm,"loud, clear, ringing territorial calls of male can be heard up to a kilometre away in winter breeding season. Call is a series of notes, initially slow, sharp, becoming lower, richer, faster, increasingly powerful, almost painfully loud if the bird comes close under low cover. The sound is not unpleasant, is even musical, yet has something of the metallic screech of a dry bearing forced to turn, a short, sharp, loud squeak at each revolution, faster and loud: ""chwiep, chwiep, chwip-C`HWIPCHWIP-CHIWIEP-chwp-chwp"".",
216,"Scrub-birds, Bristlebirds",Eastern Bristlebird,Dasyornis brachypteus,20-22cm,"songs of varied cheerful, musical notes, some extremely high and weak, others more mellow, clear and strong; some sequences with slight whp-crack finish. Repeats a sequence several times, then adds variations: ""wit-wit wheerie-whEIT""; ""chi-chi-cheery-whEIT; ""wht-wheeeir-weeit-weeit-whit""; ""queeity-queeeir"". In alarm a scolding ""chzzzt-chzzzt"".",
216,"Scrub-birds, Bristlebirds",Western Bristlebird,Dasyornis longirostris,18-21cm,"similar to Eastern Bristlebird; has slightly sad quality reminiscent of lonely moonlight singing of Willie Wagtail. Song at the eastern end of its range differs in detail from song of separated populations further west; variations by individual birds. Intermixed sharp and mellow notes form descending sequences: ""tchip-eeee, quit-a-weer""; ""tchip-it-er-pieerit""; and ""quiee-ity-pieer, quieeity-pieer"".",
216,"Scrub-birds, Bristlebirds",Rufous Bristlebird,Dasyornis broadbenti,24-27cm,"a clear, ringing whistle; if recognised, helps locate these shy birds. Ususally a series of clear, sharp notes lead into a much stronger, quick, double whip-crack; these last notes are often repeated by the female: ""chip, chip, chip, chup, CHEE-O-WHIP"".",
218,Treecreepers,White-browed Treecreeper,Climacteris affinis,14-15cm,"sharp, abrupt, very metallic and penetrating, ""chrip, chrip, chrip"" and as a double noted ""chip-chip-, chip-chip"". Also a rapid trill, a ripple of sharp, metallic sound lasting several seconds.",
218,Treecreepers,Brown Treecreeper,Climacteris picumnus,16-18cm,"a clear, high""whit, whit, whit, whit""; each note has a strong sharp finish.",
218,Treecreepers,Rufous Treecreeper,Climacteris rufa,15-17cm,"sharp, ringing ""chip, chip, chip"", widely an regularly spaced, 2-5 seconds apart. The trill is very high and sharp, descending and slowing, lasting 2 or 3 seconds.",
218,Treecreepers,Black-tailed Treecreeper,Climacteris melanura,17-20cm,"sharp , regular ""chip, chip, chip"" at intervals of about a second, similar to call of Rufous; also as a rapid descending trill, ""chip-chip-chipchipipipip"".",
218,Treecreepers,Red-browed Treecreeper,Climacteris erythrops,14-15.5cm,"squeaks at very high pitch, weak, thin ""iep, iep, iep"". Also a fast, scratchy trill; begins exremely high and squeaky, ends with several stronger, harsher squeaks: ""iep-ip-ip-ip-i-i-i-i-ip-chzip-chziep-chziep""; in the distance sounds more like the trill of a fairy wren than of a treecreeper.",
218,Treecreepers,White-throated Treecreeper,Cormobates leucophaeus,13-15cm,"loud, ringing, clear, musical ""whit-whit-whit-whit-"", rippling ""quit-quit-quit-"" and more mellow, musical ""twiet-twiet-twiet-"". Also a loud, rippling trill.",
220,Purple-crowned and Blue Fairy-wrens,Purple-crowned Fairy-wren,Malurus coronatus,14-16cm,"distinctive, not the high and often weak trill of other fair-wrens, but a strong, vigorous, reeling sequence with some almost harsh notes. Commonly a vigorous, rollicking, scrub-wren-like ""zeepa-zeipa-zeipa"" or ""cheipa-cheipa-"". Many variants: ""tcheip-tcheip-tcheip-"" and ""tzwip-tzwip-tzwip-"".",
220,Purple-crowned and Blue Fairy-wrens,White-winged Fairy-wren,Malurus leucopterus,12-13cm,"an undulating, musical, reeling trill that carries some distance in open country and which has a metallic, mechanial quality to it. Undulating pitch and volume give an impression of uneven mechanical rotation, like a rapidly retrieving fishing reel or a sewing machine at fluctuating speed: ""chirr-IRR-irr-IRIRit-chirr-IRRirit-irirIRIRRIT-chirrir-IRRITirrit-"", a pleasant, rollicking sound that is sustained and repeated. Also has an abrupt, high, weak, insect-like ""prrit!"".",
220,Purple-crowned and Blue Fairy-wrens,Splendid Fairy-wren,Malurus splendens,13-14cm,"song a very rapid tremulous trill, the ""reeling"" much less pronounced than in the call of the White-winged, but gives the Splendid's song an undulating quality. The notes forming the 3 or 4 seconds duration of the song vary; usually high, squeaky sounds intermingle with softer or mellow notes, or begins with vry rapd, high, insect-like squeaks for a second or two, then mves to lower, stronger or whistled notes, but usually with a reeling, rhythmic pattern: ""trit-triiit-trit-tirreet-tirreet-trit-tirreet-tirreet"". Other sounds include extremely high, short, vibrating trills, a loud, whistled warning trill, frequent weak ""trrrip"" contact squeaks and a plaintive, soft ""sreee"" seeking contact.",
220,Purple-crowned and Blue Fairy-wrens,Superb Fairy-wren,Malurus cyaneus,13-14cm,"song a vigorous trill, beginning squeakily, but quickly strengthening into a strong, downward cascade of louder, less sharp musical notes. Foraging party maintains contact with weak, sharp ""trrit"" r plaintive ""treee"" from those falling behind; strident version in alarm, ""terrrrit!"".",
222,Chestnut-shouldered Fairy-wrens,Variegated Fairy-wren,Malurus lamberti,13-14cm,"sings only in the breeding season, a high, metallic, squeaky and rather clockwork or mechancial rattling trill at fairly uniform pitch ""tririt-tirirrittirit-trit-tirrririt-trit-tirrit"". The most common call, for much of the year the predominant sound, is a hard, staccato, erratic and abrupt ""trrt-trtt, rrrr-rrt-rt-"", strong rather than high or squeaky, and apparently in warning, attracting others of the party to take up the call, and to dive into cover if there is sufficient urgency in the sound. Varied contact calls are given while foraging; these change from race to race -- a rapid, sharp ""trrit"" from east-coastal nominate race, and a thinner, squeakier, plaintive ""sreee"" from inland and northern races.",
222,Chestnut-shouldered Fairy-wrens,Lovely Fairy-wren,Malarus amabilis,13-14cm,"sings at any time of year, launching directly into a slightly descending, rippling trill. Contact call a high yet rather soft ""streee"" given continually to keep family party together; churring in alarm.",
222,Chestnut-shouldered Fairy-wrens,Blue-breasted Fairy-wren,Malarus pulcherrimus,14-15cm,"song begins with extremely high, squeaky, thin notes leading in to several seconds of lower pitched, very rapid, hard, mechanical, vibrating trilling. More often heard are rattling, mechanical alarms, ""trrrt-trt-trtt-trt-trrrt"".",
222,Chestnut-shouldered Fairy-wrens,Red-winged Fairy-wren,Malurus elegans,14-16cm,"song begins with several squeaky notes followed by a rather rattling, uniform trill; quite unlike song of Splendid, the usualy overlapping species, and separable from call of Blue-breasted, which is usually in drier inland habitats. Alarm call a strident, rapid ""trrit-trrit-trrit"".",
224,"Red-backed Fairy-wren, Emu-wrens",Red-backed Fairy-wren,Malurus melanocephalus,10-13cm,"begins with squeaks so high and weak that they would be heard only when very close, followed by a trill beginning with high squeaky notes, usually switching to lower, louder, rattling sounds: ""sreee-sreee-trichee-trichee-tchakka-tchakkatchakka"". This is usually given by males in breeding season. Contact call within foraging group is a soft ""tsiet""; the alarm call a louder, sharper ""trrrrit!"".",
224,"Red-backed Fairy-wren, Emu-wrens",Southern Emu-wren,Southern Emu-wren,15-19cm; includes tail 11-12cm,"similar to fairy-wrens but higher, weak, scratchy, yet it carries well over open heath, giving the best chance to locate birds; may be beyond upper limit of hearing of some observers. The squeaky calls have an undulating, rollicking variation of volume and pitch, ""siee-seit-tzeet-tzeet-siee-seeit-tzeeit-tzeet-seee-seeit"".",
224,"Red-backed Fairy-wren, Emu-wrens",Mallee Emu-wren,Stipiturus mallee,13-15cm; includes tail 11-12cm,"like southern Emu-wren, but weaker. The song is a feeble trill of squeaky, weak, insect-like sounds lasting 2 or 3 seconds, usually from males in breeding season. More frequently given is the high, metallic squeak of the contact call, a thin, drawn out ""sreeep"". Although weak, this sound carries some distance, and, together with the stronger alarm call, gives the best chance of locating these birds that so persistently stay out of sight. The alarm is a sharper, harsh, abrupt ""tirrit"".",
224,"Red-backed Fairy-wren, Emu-wrens",Rufous-crowned Emu-wren,Stipiturus ruficeps,12-13cm; includes tail 6.5-7.5cm,"similar to other emu-wrens, but extremely high, weak. Contact call a fine, penetrating, cricket-like, squeaked ""tseeet-tseeet-tzeeet-"". Song, usually given by males in breeding season, is a fast succession of scratchy, squeaky notes, seeming jumbled rather than trilled, at varied strengths and pitches. Like that of Southern Emu-wren but weaker, higher; most calls high to extremely high, often beyond observers' hearing unless very close.",
226,Grasswrens,Black Grasswren,Amytornis housei,19-21cm,"calls are distinctive and quite loud, making any search for these birds easier. The song is harsher, stronger than that of any of the much smaller fairy-wrens of the region. Gives a rather metallic, slow, rattling sequence, into which are inserted low, husky and high, scratchy, squeaky sound and contrasting brief, clear, mellow, musical, rising whistles: ""chaka-chuk-seeeip-chuk-zwiEEEP, chak-chukchuk-chewiEEEP! chuk-chuk-seeip"".",
226,Grasswrens,White-throated Grasswren,Amytornis woodwardi,20-22cm,"foraging flocks keep together with sharp, scratchy ""chwiep"" contact calls; break into harsher ""tzzrrrt!"" alarm calls at the slightest sign of danger. The song, perhaps given only in the breeding season, is loud, rich, and varied, rather like that of the Reed Warbler, an intermix of sharp and deep rich, musical notes, ""chziep-chiep-quorrop, chirrip-chok, chwiep-quarriep-"".",
226,Grasswrens,Carpentarian Grasswren,Amytornis dorotheae,16-17cm,"contact within groups is maintained with a high, cricket-like ""tseeit"". In warning a harsher, buzzing ""tzzeit, tzzeit"". The song is a rapid, cheerful, canary-like warbling, a musical intermingling of squeaky, high trills and deeper, stronger, prolonged churring sounds: ""chrrip-chewip-chur-r-r-r-r-r-p.""",
226,Grasswrens,Grey Grasswren,Amytornis barbatus,17.5-20cm,"contact between birds is maintained by very high-pitched, quick ""tsip"" calls, given by one, answered by others in the group -- an almost unbroken, twittering rippling of metallic, squeaky ""tsit-tsit-tsit, tsit-tzit, tsit"" calls that continues for several seconds. The alarm is a high, squeaked ""tseeep"".",
226,Grasswrens,Eyrean Grasswren,Amytornis goyderi,15-16cm,"contact calls are extremely high-pitched, weak, insect-like squeaks, probably inaudible unless close by: ""tseee"" and tinkling, squeaked ""tsip-tsip-tseee-tsip"". Song begins with these same high squeaks, changing abruptly to a fast, louder, lower, rattling, musical chatter, ""tsee-tseee-chakachakachaka""; alarm a sharp, strong ""tzeeet"".",
228,Grasswrens,Striated Grasswren,Amytornis striatus,15-18.5cm,"the contact calls are high, scratchy squeaks and trills, ""tsee-tsee, tzee, chweep-chweep-chweep""; in alarm a harsher, louder ""tzirrr!"". The song begins with simiar high squeaks, quickly followed by rapid, loud, clear, rippling, musical notes, ""tsee-tsee, piew-piew-piew"".",
228,Grasswrens,Short-tailed Grasswren,Amytornis merrotsyi,NA,NA,until recently thought sub-species
228,Grasswrens,Thick-billed Grasswren,Amytornis textilis,15-20cm,"western race has quite a strong call, usually a persistent, rather treecreeper-like, whistled ""cheep-cheep-cheep"" that may be extended into a brief musical, rattling trill, ""chip-chip, chew-wekaweka""; eastern race extremely high, soft ""see-see-see"" and brief squeaky trill, ""see-see, tsewit-tsewit"".",
228,Grasswrens,Dusky Grasswren,Amytornis purnelli,15-18cm,"high rippling trill, the first several ntes faint squeaks, the rest an undulating ow-high sequence, ""see-see, tchoo-tchoo-chee""; contact calls, weak twitterings, ""tsee-tsee-tsee-""; harsher, staccato ""tchik-tchik!"" in alarm.",
228,Grasswrens,Kalkadoon Grasswren,Amytornis ballarae,NA,NA,until recently sub-species
230,Pardalotes,Spotted Pardalote,Pardalotus punctatus,8-10cm,"contact call is repeated regularly for long periods; an even, musical, soft, whistled ""weep-weeip"". The song is a sequence of clear whistled notes, ""whee, whee-bee"" or ""sleep, may-bee"". The sound of the yellow-rumped race has a quiet, rather mournful quality: ""chnk-whee-a-bee"", soft, high, then falling away.",
230,Pardalotes,Forty-spotted Pardalote,Pardalotus quadragintus,9-10cm,"similar to that of the Spotted Pardalote, perhaps harsher, double-noted ""wheet-whoo""; a louder, nasal ""twnnt"" in the breeding season.",
230,Pardalotes,Red-browed Pardalote,Pardalotus rubricatus,10-12cm,"distinctive, pleasant song quite unlike that of other pardalotes; a loud, mellow whistle of five or six notes, one or several slow and rising, three to five higher, quicker, the result like a softly muted Crested Bellbird or rosella.",
230,Pardalotes,Striated Pardalote,Pardalotus striatus,9.5-11.5cm,"clear, sharp, musical ""witta-witta"", the second part slightly lower, repeated regularly at several second intervals or long periods; also gives soft, low trills.",
232,"Pilotbird, Rock Warbler, Brown Srubwrens, Scrubtit",Pilotbird,Pycnoptilus floccosus,16.5-17cm,"the male's loud call described as having ""piercing sweetness""; ""whit-wheet-WHEE-a-wer"" or fast ""whit-whit-WHEER, whit-whit-WHEER""; these and other variations have the clear musical quality of bristlebird calls. Females also may give these calls and softer ""whitta-whittee"" and ""too-whit-too-whittee"" responses.",
232,"Pilotbird, Rock Warbler, Brown Srubwrens, Scrubtit",Rockwarbler,Origma solitaria,13-14cm,"a clear ""chweep-chweep"" with a slightly mournful quality to the sound. Also a sharper ""chwik-chwik"", and harsh, scolding ""tzzt, tzzt"".",

234,"Fernwren, Dark-faced Scrubwrens",Fernwren,Oreoscopus gutturalis,13-15cm,"a high, fine, ""pee-pee-PEEEE"", the last note strongly whistled, musical; another call is softer, brief, more even: ""pip-pip-pip-peeeee"". These calls are rather like display calls of Pied Honeyeater.",
234,"Fernwren, Dark-faced Scrubwrens",Yellow-throated Scrubwren,Sericornis citreogularis,12-14cm,"varied melodious, cheery, whistled calls, rather like those of Mistletoebird. Commonly a sequence of very sharp notes intermixed with slightly lower, more mellow notes, ""sieeip-chzweep-chip-sieep-chzeep"". An accomplished mimic of the calls of other birds. Contact calls sharp, abrupt ""chiep, chiep, chiep"". Scolds harshly: ""chzzak-chzzak-chzzak"". Birds of far northern population can have more chattering, less whistling in repertoire.",
234,"Fernwren, Dark-faced Scrubwrens",White-browed Scrubwren,Sericornis frontalis,11-13cm,"song is a high, clear, varied whistle: ""ch-weip, ch-weip, ch-weip""; ""chi-wipip, chi-wipip""; ""chp-wiep, chp-wiep""; ""cheweep-chip""; and a very high ""ts-eeer, tseeer"", the second syllable usually higher. In alarm, scolds with sharp, hard, metallic, rattling ""chk-chk-ckchkchk"" or buzzing ""tzzzt-tzzt-tzzt"". As contact between members of the group while foraging, softer, more intimate chittering and churring sounds. Often includes mimicry of other species.",
234,"Fernwren, Dark-faced Scrubwrens",Tasmanian Scrubwren,Sericornis humilis,12-14cm,"calls ""chzit-chzit"", very scratchy, sharp; the song is described as like a squeaking wheel, a scratchy, squeaky ""chzeit-chzit-chzitty-chzitty-chzitty"". The alarm call is a scolding, rasping chatter.",
236,"Heathwrens, Fieldwrens, Speckled Warbler",Chestnut-rumped Heathwren,Hylacola pyrrhopygia,13-14cm,"renowned for its spirited song into which is blended passages of mimicry of other bids in high, clear, pure, silvery noes: ""fchweep-tweep-toowheet, tweet-wheeit-wheeit, chirreeep, twitchy-twitchy-quorrop-quorreep"", and similar notes in seemingly endless variety. Harsh chatting and scolding, ""chzzt-chzzzt!"", in alarm.",
236,"Heathwrens, Fieldwrens, Speckled Warbler",Shy Heathwren,Hylacola cauta,12-14cm,"song a clear, sharp, musical sequence, not as sustained or varied as that of the Chestnut-rumped. It begins with several high, thin squeaks, then stronger, a touch of buzzing rattle that fades away: ""see-sree, chweip-chzeip-quirrip-quip-chip-chie"". In alarm, harsh scolding.",
236,"Heathwrens, Fieldwrens, Speckled Warbler",Striated Fieldwren,Calamanthus fuliginosus,13-14cm,"the male climbs to the top of a shrub to deliver his song, tail waving sideways as he pours forth a lively, although subdued, succession of trills and chatterings: ""whit-whit wirree, whit-whit-whitCHIER, chrrit-chrrit-chrrit"".

The sound is distinctive: a rolling, swwelling and fading, mellow rattling, rising and strenghtening for several seconds, ""trrreee-"", then falling, ""-iurr"", giving an undulating ""trreee-iurr, trreee-iurr, trreee-iur-"".",
304,"Cuckoo-shrikes, Cicadabird",Black-faced Cuckoo-shrike,Coracina novaehollandiae,30-36cm,"a loud, sharp churring, harsh yet rather musical; often starts quite high then falls, ""churrieer"", or a descending ""quarieer-quarieer-quarrieer"". Harsher sounds in aggression.",
304,"Cuckoo-shrikes, Cicadabird",White-bellied Cuckoo-shrike,Coracina papuensis,26-28cm,"distinctive, but reminisent of some calls of Black-faced Cuckoo-shrike.

306,"Orioles, Figbird",Olive-backed Oriole,Oriolus sagittatus,25-28cm,"calls are mellow and resonant, not the very deepy bubbling of the Yellow Oriole, but mostly higher, clearer and more musical. A frequently repeated sequence is a rollicking ""orry-orry-orriole"", quite clearly pronouncing itself to be an ""oriole"". The song is a prolonged version of the call, wandering through similar sequences of notes, often with mimicry of other birds ""quiee-kwee-kworri-kworriole""; also varied querulous squawking and rasping sounds.",
306,"Orioles, Figbird",Figbird,Sphecotheres viridis,28-29cm,"calls are many and varied: commonly used is a rising and falling, loud, penetrating yet quite musical ""tsee-chieuw"", or faster ""tsichiew"". In each case the beginning ""tsee"" or ""tsi"" is very brief and high, just a lead in to the long, descending, strongly whistled ""chieuw"". A few calls from within the group or flock are usually answered by others, the many whistles intermingling in a confusion of sound with the individual calls seeming to be given faster, the calling more excited: ""tsee-chieuw, tseechieuw, tsichiew-tchiew"". Also has various erratic notes both clear and harsh. The song is mellower by strong: ""too, too-heer, too-tooheer"" and similar sequences including mimicry of other birds.",

Loudest, often given in wing-quivering flight, are vigorous piping notes that gradually develop a harsh, strident, scolding quality towards the end of the sequence, rapid and lively, ""quayk-quayk-quiak-qraik-qzaik-kzaaik-kzaaik-kzzaik'.",
310,Butcherbirds,Black-headed Butcherbird,Cracticus mentalis,26-28cm,"usually deeper, richer and slower than that of Grey Butcherbird; includes duets, mimicry.

310,Butcherbirds,Pied Butcherbird,Cracticus nigrogularis,33-36cm,"best heard at dawn during breeding season, or on still, moonlit nights. The sound combines the slow, rich, deep, mellow quality of butcherbirds with the flowing carolling of the Australian Magpie in fluted, far-carrying notes that seem to reflect the loneliness of its outback haunts. Often answered by others, near or distant, in duet or following in sequence, with notes that switch abruptly from high and clear to deep and mellow, but which always seem perfectly chosen.",
312,Australian Magpie,Australian Magpie,Gymnorhina tibicen,37-44cm,"strong, rich and varied carolling, with notes ranging from high and clear to deep and mellow. Often a second bird, or many of the group, join to construct a duet or chorus. This communal territory song is strongest in early to mid-spring months; often sings at night.

Usually given by many or a group together, calls intermingling.

Includes a harsh, scrtatchy ""scrairch-scaach"", grinding, grating sounds, louder ""tziiew, tz-iew"" and rough abrupt warning calls; garrulous participation in any flock activities.

Song is a loud, varied, initially hgh, squeaky sequence of descending, reeling notes, finishing with harsh, deep chuckling notes given in song flight or from a high perch; has some similarity to song of the Rufous Songlark. Calls mostly in early morning and towards evening.",
444,Old World Warblers,Little Grassbird,Megalurus gramineus,13-15cm,"the call is often the only indication of the presence of the secrtive grassbirds in their typically dense habtat; a mournful whistle of three notes, the first soft, low and brief, the second and third at high and even pitch, drawn out, ""whp-wheeee-wheeeee"" and ""whp-whiooo"". In alarm, a harsh, rattling chatter.",
444,Old World Warblers,Golden-headed Cisticola,Cisticola exilis,9-11cm,"spring and summer, calls almost incessantly. Drawn out, metallic, buzzing ""trzzzzeep"" sounds are interspersed with quick, clear, musical ""teewip"" calls; also has higher, faster, buzzing ""tizzzeip"" and ""weezzz, whit-whit"".",
444,Old World Warblers,Zitting Cisticola,Cisticola juncidis,9-11cm,"when breeding, the male has a persistent zitting call. Flying high in display, he almost hovers in slow undulating flight into the wind, giving a ""tzip-ip, tzip-zip"" call.",
444,Old World Warblers,Rufous Songlark,Cincloramphus mathewsi,16-19cm,"males are noisy with almost continuous song in the breeding season: a single ringing, almost whipcrack ""whitcher""; or joyful full song -- a metallic, yet plesant and musical, rollicking ""whitcher-whitcher, a-whitchy-wheedle-whitch"".",
444,Old World Warblers,Brown Songlark,Cincloramphus cruralis,18-19cm,"loud, clear; the tune or pattern of notes is jerky, erratic; the notes are often abrupt, varying from hard, metallic noises and buzzing sounds to clear and musical notes. Some of the sounds have been appropriately described as like the dry squeaking of a metal cartwheel turning slowly on a rusty axle. The overall effect, however, is cheerful, pleasant and distinctive. While the song is varied, patterns become recognisable. A small typical sample -- ""skzit-kotch-zzweiler, chweeip, kzzeech-kotch-aweiler"" -- finishes with a musical trill and whipcrack. This song has resulted in the Brown Songlark being known to children as the ""Skit, scot,a-wheeler"".",
446,"White-eyes, Silveryeye",Pale White-eye,Zosterops citrinellus,11-12cm,"contact call is a quite loud chirp. The song is a rising and falling sequence of clear, sweetly warbled notes; overall less plaintive than that of the Silvereye.",
446,"White-eyes, Silveryeye",Yellow White-eye,Zosterops luteus,11-12cm,"strong, high pitched, whistled contact or flocking calls, possibly louder than those of the Silvereye, and tinkling notes from foraging flocks. The song is strong, varied and tuneful with musical warbling and trills.",
446,"White-eyes, Silveryeye",Silvereye,Zosterops lateralis,11-13cm,"a clear, peevish ""tseeep""; song a rather slow, erratic series of clear, sharp, slightly peevish notes: ""tsweeip-cheeip, peeip-a-chweip, cheeip"" with many slightly different variations in rambling sequence, often rather lengthy; there is a different, more hesitant version that is used at first light. In a softer, quieter sub-song, mimicry of some other birds may be included. Calls of western race, gouldi, are perhaps slightly more harsh.",
448,"Thrushes, Bulbul",Bassian Thrush,Zoothera lunulata,27-29cm,"usually silent, most likely to be heard at dawn or in dull weather. Song consists of three clear notes, the first level, the second rising briefly, the third again steady -- ""wheeer-aoo-whooo"" -- and may continue as a soft tuneful sub-song.",
448,"Thrushes, Bulbul",Russet-tailed Thrush,Zoothera heinei,26-29cm,"the call differs recognisably from that of the Bassian, described as two clear, whistled notes, the second lower, ""wheee-rooo"".",
448,"Thrushes, Bulbul",Song Thrush,Turdus philomelos,22-23cm,"male sings almost continuously through the breeding season, a clear, spirited sequence of notes; mimics native birds. In contact and in flight, a thin ""tsip"".",
448,"Thrushes, Bulbul",Blue Rock Thrush,Monticola solitarius,22-23cm,"low clucking sounds and a pleasant, reedy song.",
448,"Thrushes, Bulbul",Red-whiskered Bulbul,Pycnonotus jocosus,20-22cm,"a trilled, fluid, musical whistle in contact and advertisement of presence or territory, and much lively chattering, harsh scolding sounds in alarm or warning.",
550,"Starlings, Myna, Blackbird",Metallic Starling,Aplonis metallica,22-24cm,"various nasal and wheezing calls -- from individuals, ""scriaarch, scraark, scraich-scraich-scraaairch, chrak-chrak-chrak"" and similar sounds. From the flock, a jumbled racket of intermixed squawking and wheezing.",
550,"Starlings, Myna, Blackbird",Common Starling,Sturnus vulgaris,20-21cm,"most characteristic call a long downwards whistle, and ""chwee""; also high ""tizz-tzz"", and diverse wheezing, rattling and clicking noises; includes mimicry.",
550,"Starlings, Myna, Blackbird",Common Myna,Acridotheres tristris,23-25cm,"a mix of loud, clear and mellow whistles, especially a high, clear and vigorous ""wheeoo, wheeoo, wheeoo"" and contrasting harsh, rattling ""carrarrk, carrarrk"" and sharp ""tseit-tseit"". Gives a clear, liquid note on take off.",
550,"Starlings, Myna, Blackbird",Common Blackbird,Turdus merula,25-26cm,"in contact, a high, fine ""tseee"", and harsh, almost screeching chatter of alarm when in flight. The song is a pleasant, mellow fluting sound with higher trills.",
