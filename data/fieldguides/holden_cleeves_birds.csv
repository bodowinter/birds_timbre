285,Finches,Siskin,Carduelis spinus,12cm,"Call, frequently given in flight, is a clear, loud ""tsuu"" or a ringing ""tszng"". Song is a sweet twittering that includes a drawn-out wheeze."
286,Finches,Linnet,Carduelis cannabina,13.5cm,"Song of male, which may be heard at any time of year, but especially in spring, is a rather fast and pleasant warbling that has a slightly wheezy quality. Flight call is a rapid twittering ""chi, chi, chi, chit""."
287,Finches,Twite,Carduelis flavirostris,14cm,"Call usually incorporates a harsh ""twaaay"", similar to a Linnet but more ""nasal"". Also makes a more drawn-out ""tchway"" and ""tchway-de-wee"". Song is a variety of these individual notes, and not as well formed as that of Linnet."
288,Finches,Lesser Redpoll,Carduelis cabaret,11.5cm,"Flight call is a purring trill. Its song incorporates the trill and a twittering ""chi, chi, chi, chi"" that is usually given in its songflight."
289,Finches,Common Redpoll,Carduelis flammea,12.5cm,"The call is a trilling ""tji-tji-tji""."
290,Finches,Crossbill,Loxia curvirostra,16.5cm,"Call is a sharp ""chip, chip, chip"" and flocks make a loud crescendo of ""chips"". At dusk it makes a Blackbird-like ""chink-chink"". Song is an unremarkable soft twittering."
291,Finches,Scottish Crossbill,Loxia scotica,16.5cm,"The call is a hard, sharp ""chup, chup""."
292,Finches,Parrot Crossbill,Loxia pytyopsittacus,16-18cm,"Similar to Crossbill although some observers have described a deeper emphatic ""quop, quop"" call. Song tends to be lower, slower and slightly better enunciated than the Crossbill."
293,Finches,Common Rosefinch,Carpodacus erythrinus,14.5-15cm,"Most usual call is a loud ""chew-ee, chew-ee"" like the contact calls of young Willow Warblers but louder and the first syllable harsher. Song is a simple but very variable ""sit-too-swit-too""."
294,Finches,Bullfinch,Pyrrhula phrrhula,14.5cm,"Usual call soft but distinctive ""peu, peu"" and also quieter piping as birds keep contact in dense cover. Song is a quiet, creaking or piping warble and is seldom heard."
295,Finches,Hawfinch,Coccothraustes coccothraustes,18cm,"Most common call is a short ""tic, tic"", slightly harder than a Robin's alarm call. The rarely heard song is a slow ""deek, waree, ree, ree""."
296,Bunting,Lapland Bunting,Calcarius lapponicus,15-16cm,"Flight call is a distinctive dry, rattling ""terrek"". Sometimes it will make a Snow Bunting-like descending ""teu"" call. Song is quite musical and given during a songflight."
297,Bunting,Snow bunting,Plectrophenax nivalis,16-17cm,"Call, usually heard in flight, is a rippling twittering ""tirrirrirrip"". There are calls that sound like ""seu""and ""sichew"". Song is loud and musical and given from a perch or in flight."
298,Bunting,Yellowhammer,Emberiza citrinella,16-16.5cm,"Call is a sharp, clipped ""zit"" or soft ""trillp"". The famous ""little-bit-of-bread-and-no-cheese"" description of the song helps to describe the pace and form, which is variable, but tends to be a rapid succession of repeated notes with the last phrase drawn out into a long wheeze. Song is repeated monotonously during breeding season."
299,Bunting,Cirl Bunting,Emberiza cirlus,15.5cm,"Call a rather thin, high-pitched ""stic, stic"", higher and more metallic than Yellowhammer. Song heard between February and September; a rattling trill of a single repeated note - quite similar to the song of a Lesser Whitethroat and not unlike a Yellowhammer's song, but lacking the ""cheese"" at the end."
300,Bunting,Reed Bunting,Emberiza schoeniclus,15cm,"Usual call is shrill ""tsew"" that is given in flight, and also a metallic ""ching"". Song is very simple an repetitive; it is a collection of a few metallic notes ending in an unremarkable flourish ""tweek, tweek, tweek, titty-tweek""."
301,Bunting,Ortolan Bunting,Emberiza hortulana,16cm,"The call is a shrill ""tseeup"" or a liquid ""tip"". The song resembles Beethoven's Fifth Symphony - a short, simple ""dee, dee, dee, deee"" with a flat note at the end."
302,Bunting,Corn Bunting,Miliaria calandra,18cm,"Males with several mates sing more than males with only one. Song may start when males visit their territories in January or February and soon sing incessantly throughout the day. Song is an accelerating series of jangling notes that has been likened to jangling of keys. Call is a rather abrupt ""quit""."
