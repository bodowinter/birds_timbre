Abert's Towhee,Melozone aberti,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,22.15,"Pairs frequently deliver a 'squeal duet,' a rapid jumble of scratchy notes, and this can be a good way to locate the species. They also make a high-pitched, distinctive, ringing  "" seep "" or  "" peep "" call. Males occasionally sing a very simple series of sweet, ringing, staccato  "" peep "" call notes on the same pitch, usually introduced with a lower-pitched note."
Acadian Flycatcher,Empidonax virescens,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,14.5,"Typical calls include a sharp  "" pwit  "" and a series of slowly trilled twittered notes. Acadian Flycatchers sing a short, explosive  "" tee-chup  "" or  "" ker-chip  "" frequently throughout the breeding season, particularly in the morning. They also sing a 'dawn song' consisting of the territorial song interspersed with metallic  "" seet  "" notes given very rapidly. In addition they sing an 'evening song,' often in flight, consisting of a series of  "" pseet  "" calls followed by slurred chirps. These build to a climax, at which point the male flies above the canopy while continuing to sing."
Acorn Woodpecker,Melanerpes formicivorus,Picidae,Piciformes,21,"Their most common call is a loud, squeaky  "" waka-waka-waka "" , used for greeting family members, disputing territory boundaries, and squabbling in groups. They also give noisy trills, harsh repeated notes, chatters, and other calls. "
African Collared-Dove,Streptopelia roseogrisea,Columbidae,Columbiformes,26.5,"Song is a mellow  "" koo, kooroo. ""  Call a high-pitched  "" heh-heh-heh. ""  "
Alder Flycatcher,Empidonax alnorum,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,15,"The primary contact call is a low, flat  "" pip. "" Males sing a burry  "" rreeee-BEEP  "" or  "" free-beer! "" , reminiscent of but thinner than an Eastern Phoebe's song."
Allen's Hummingbird,Selasphorus sasin,Trochilidae,Caprimulgiformes,9,"Males and females frequently give a sharp tick while feeding. If another hummingbird tries to intrude on a male's territory, he gives a quick 3-parted tinkling buzz from his perch. Females make the same sound in response to a displaying male. "
Altamira Oriole,Icterus gularis,Icteridae,Passeriformes,23,"A clipped  "" ike  "" is the most commonly heard call, likely used as a contact call. Harsh chattering calls are also common. Both adults also give a sweet, two-note whistle when approaching young with food. Males sing a pleasant-sounding series of whistled phrases, some rising, others falling in tone, with regular pauses between the phrases, and occasional harsh chattering interspersed."
American Avocet,Recurvirostra americana,Recurvirostridae,Charadriiformes,45,"The call of male and female American Avocets is a repeated, high-pitched  "" kleet "" . They are generally silent, calling only when disturbed. "
American Bittern,Botaurus lentiginosus,Ardeidae,Pelecaniformes,72.5,"When flushed, American Bitterns often emit a hoarse  "" kok-kok-kok "" or nasal  "" haink "" . Males may give a continual  "" chu-peep "" call during mating. To communicate with each other through dense vegetation American Bitterns use low-frequency calls, which carry farther than higher-pitched sounds. During breeding season the males make a bizarre, resonant three-syllable  "" pump-er-lunk "" call with a liquid quality; females may respond with a similar but quieter sound. The male's call is preceded by clacking and gulping. To accomplish the  "" pump-er-lunk "" sound, the male inflates his esophagus by way of almost violent body contortions—opening and closing his bill as if lunging for flying insects—and then uses the stored air to unleash his call. Repeated up to 10 times in succession, the call probably serves as both a territorial signal and an advertisement for mates. "
American Black Duck,Anas rubripes,Anatidae,Anseriformes,56.5,"American Black Duck females give loud quacks, along with a six-syllable call that falls in pitch, with an accent on the second syllable. Males have raspy, reedy calls and they give a flutelike whistle during courtship. "
American Coot,Fulica americana,Rallidae,Gruiformes,41.15,"Although none of the vocalizations of American Coot can properly be considered a 'song,' this is a highly vocal species that calls with a variety of grunting, croaking, and squawking noises. The most common call is a short single-noted  "" krrp "" or  "" prik "" . "
American Crow,Corvus brachyrhynchos,Corvidae,Passeriformes,46.5,"Crows have more than 20 calls. The most common, a harsh caw, has several qualities and lengths that may serve different purposes. Immature begging young American Crows give a higher-pitched, nasal call that can sound like a Fish Crow. You may also hear a variety of calls and alert calls given to rally others to mob predators. The American Crow is not known for the beauty of its song, a series of loud caws. You may also hear crows making a 'subsong': a mixture of hoarse or grating coos, caws, rattles, and clicks. These are arranged in sequences that can be many minutes long, given quietly and with a rambling, improvised quality."
American Dipper,Cinclus mexicanus,Cinclidae,Passeriformes,17,"Call is a sharp  "" zeet. ""  Song is clear and ringing, with repeated notes."
American Golden-Plover,Pluvialis dominica,Charadriidae,Charadriiformes,26,"Flight call a whistled  "" que-del, ""  or  "" tuu-u-ee. ""  Song a rapid series of abrupt whistled notes."
American Goldfinch,Spinus tristis,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,12,"The American Goldfinch's most common call is its contact call, often given in flight. It sounds like the bird is quietly saying  "" po-ta-to-chip "" with a very even cadence. Birds sometimes give harsh threat calls when in feeding flocks or at the nest. Males make a  "" tee-yee "" courtship call upon landing near a female in spring or early summer, often followed by a burst of song. Females brooding nestlings make a rapid sequence of high notes when they hear their mate approaching with food. Birds at their nest make a loud, two-parted  "" bay-bee "" call if they feel threatened. Males sing a long and variable series of twitters and warbles that can be several seconds long. The notes and phrases are variable and repeated in a seemingly random order. Birds continue to learn song patterns throughout life."
American Kestrel,Falco sparverius,Falconidae,Falconiformes,26.5,"American Kestrels have a fairly limited set of calls, but the most common one is a loud, excited series of 3-6  "" klee! "" or  "" killy! "" notes lasting just over a second. It's distinctive and an excellent way to find these birds. You may also hear two other common calls: a long whine that can last 1-2 minutes, heard in birds that are courting or feeding fledglings, and a fast chitter, usually used by both sexes in friendly interactions. "
American Oystercatcher,Haematopus palliatus,Haematopodidae,Charadriiformes,42,"American Oystercatchers make several high-pitched, sharp, and incisive calls, usually written  "" peep "" ,  "" pip "" ,  "" hueep "" , and  "" weeer.  "" These function as pairing, contact, and alarm calls; most are far-carrying in the open environments the birds inhabit.  "
American Pipit,Anthus rubescens,Motacillidae,Passeriformes,15.5,"The most common call is a rising  "" pi-pit "" , usually given by flying birds, either singly or in flocks. Males on the nesting grounds give a variety of similar calls (often in rapid series) when confronting rivals, warning females of danger, or arriving with food at the nest. Females give a quick series of  "" wee "" calls when soliciting food from a mate and a soft  "" peet  "" when accepting the food.   Males sing a repeated  "" chwee  "" in flight (sometimes from the ground), with the delivery of notes quickening as the bird descends."
American Redstart,Setophaga ruticilla,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12,"Both the male and female use a variety of calls in different situations, including sharp, sweet-sounding  "" chip "" notes, soft  "" tsip "" calls, and high-pitched alarm calls. During breeding season the male sings a series of 2-11 thin, high-pitched notes, sometimes ending with an accented phrase. The building energy of the song and the abrupt, accented ending lead some people to describe the song as sneeze-like."
American Robin,Turdus migratorius,Turdidae,Passeriformes,24,"American Robins often make a mumbled  "" cuck "" or  "" tuk "" to communicate with each other or a sharp  "" yeep "" or  "" peek "" as an alarm call. They also make a repeated  "" chirr "" that rises in volume and can sound like a laugh or chuckle. The musical song of the American Robin is a familiar sound of spring. It's a string of 10 or so clear whistles assembled from a few often-repeated syllables, and often described as  "" cheerily, cheer up, cheer up, cheerily, cheer up "" . The syllables rise and fall in pitch but are delivered at a steady rhythm, with a pause before the bird begins singing again. At dawn, the song is more rapid."
American Three-toed Woodpecker,Picoides dorsalis,Picidae,Piciformes,22,"The most commonly heard calls are a sharp  "" pik "" or nasal  "" klimp "" . These calls are higher in pitch than similar calls of Black-backed. Both sexes also give a descending, fussy rattle like other small woodpeckers and recalling a kingfisher call, often delivered in flight. Birds performing displays together give a twittering call. "
American Tree Sparrow,Spizelloides arborea,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,14,"When feeding or foraging in flocks, American Tree Sparrows toss back and forth a musical twitter, sometimes described as a  "" teel-wit "" or  "" teedle-eet "" , which may vary from flock to flock. Alarmed, they give a hard  "" tseet "" . In flight, they make a softer  "" tsiew "" . Females solicit copulation with a  "" whey-whey-whey "" while fluttering their wings and raising their tails. Males sing a series of high, sweet whistled notes, generally falling slightly in pitch overall, often with clearer notes followed by more complex patterns. A song lasts about 1-2 seconds. There are many song dialects, each shared by many males, but each male sings only one. Singing begins in late winter before the spring migration."
American White Pelican,Pelecanus erythrorhynchos,Pelecanidae,Pelecaniformes,146,"Adults are usually silent. In aggressive and sexual encounters at the colony site, they emit frequent low, brief grunts. Chick embryos squawk before hatching to express discomfort if conditions get too hot or cold. The begging calls (described as a  "" whining grunt "" ) of hundreds of older young in the colony can be raucous.. "
American Wigeon,Mareca americana,Anatidae,Anseriformes,50.5,"American Wigeons are one of the more vocal dabbling ducks. Males give slow, high-pitched whistles year-round: during courtship, when sensing danger or disturbance, and as contact calls. Their 3-parted nasal whistle sounds a bit like someone softly blowing through a kazoo. Females don't whistle, but instead give a harsh, grating grunt or growl during courtship. "
American Woodcock,Scolopax minor,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,28,"Displaying males give a repeated, buzzy, nasal  "" peent "" while on the ground between flights. In the air, a displaying male chirps melodically for as long as 15 seconds as he zigzags downward from the apex of his display flight. "
Ancient Murrelet,Synthliboramphus antiquus,Alcidae,Charadriiformes,22,"Widely varied vocal repertoire around the nesting colony, consisting mostly of a rhythmic series of chirrups and chips. "
Anhinga,Anhinga anhinga,Anhingidae,Suliformes,85,Anhingas are generally silent expect when they are near the nest. Males and females make a loud clicking sound during nest exchanges that sounds a little like a treadle-operated sewing machine or a croaking frog with a sore throat.  
Anna's Hummingbird,Calypte anna,Trochilidae,Caprimulgiformes,10,"Calls are a series of short, sharp chip notes that may be given one at a time or one after another to make a twittering sound. Anna's Hummingbirds have a distinctive song that is long for a hummingbird (10 seconds or more). It's a series of buzzes, then a clearer, more tuneful whistle, followed by more emphatic chip notes; then the bird may repeat the whole set of buzz-whistle-chip sounds. It may not sound like it could be coming from a hummingbird, but once you learn to recognize it this can be a very good way to locate singing males."
Aplomado Falcon,Falco femoralis,Falconidae,Falconiformes,40.5,"The Aplomado Falcon's call is a staccato  "" kek  "" similar to the call given by American Kestrels. They also give a slower  "" kek "" at irregular intervals generally to communicate with their mate. "
Arctic Tern,Sterna paradisaea,Laridae,Charadriiformes,33.5,"Arctic Terns like other terns are boisterous birds, frequently giving shrill, grating, and high-pitched calls. When Arctic Terns are foraging or taking off from the colony they often give a high-pitched  "" kip "" . Alarmed birds make a shrill and grating scream that is higher in pitch and less grating than the similar Common Tern.  "
Arctic Warbler,Phylloscopus borealis,Phylloscopidae,Passeriformes,12," Loud and vigorous, fast and musical, but rather monotonous trill, often preceded by one or more sharp  "" tzick ""  sounds."
Arizona Woodpecker,Dryobates arizonae,Picidae,Piciformes,19,"Both sexes give a loud  "" pik "" call, similar to the most commonly heard call of Hairy Woodpecker. Males give a descending, fussy rattle and both sexes a flickerlike  "" wicka-wicka-wicka  "" when disturbed. Nesting pairs give a variety of other subtle calls near the nest. "
Ash-throated Flycatcher,Myiarchus cinerascens,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,20,"Ash-throated Flycatchers have 4 distinct calls that they give singly, in pairs, or in combination. They make a short and rapid  "" huit "" call or string them together into a trill that lasts for 4-5 seconds. The  "" br-ick "" call is less than 1 second long and rises in pitch. They give a  "" wheer "" that varies from relatively flat in pitch to rising or descending depending on their level of excitement. The final call is a short, low-pitched, burry  "" urg "" . They combine these 4 basic calls to form 2 additional calls that are often part of the dawn song, the  "" ka-brick "" and  "" ha-wheer "" calls. Males sing a repeated series of gurgling, burry notes just before dawn until about seven in the morning during the breeding season. Their non-musical song changes in pitch from high to low and sounds rather bumpy and stuttered as if they were sputtering through a whistle. The dawn song may include the  "" ha-wheer "" call or the  "" ka-brick "" call. The length of each song varies, but each burst is about 1 second long with about 2-3 seconds of silence between bursts."
Atlantic Puffin,Fratercula arctica,Alcidae,Charadriiformes,27.5,Atlantic Puffins are silent at sea. On land males often give a piglike grunt while flicking their head back to attract a female. In their breeding burrows they make a growling call similar to the sound of a muted toy chainsaw.  
Audubon's Oriole,Icterus graduacauda,Icteridae,Passeriformes,21.5,"Common calls include a rising, nasal  "" nyyyee  "" or  "" yehnk "" , ""  "" a harsh, staccato chatter (probably alarm calls), and a soft  "" piu "" , probably a contact call. Both male and female sing a rather slow, whistled, rising and falling song, recalling a slide whistle."
Bachman's Sparrow,Peucaea aestivalis,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,13.8,"Males and females give a thin high-pitched  "" tsew "" .  Male Bachman's Sparrows start their song with a long, clear or slightly buzzy note followed by a trill. Males sing throughout the day, typically from a perch above the ground. When males are agitated they also sing a bubbling song of slurs, whistles, and trills. "
Baird's Sandpiper,Calidris bairdii,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,16,"Migrants give a low-pitched, harsh, grating  "" kreep "" call similar to Pectoral Sandpiper's, probably an alarm call. On the breeding ground, adults also give this call as well as trills and a rising 'laughing' call. Males in display flight give a combination of vocalizations that serve as a song: a purring trill followed by rising  "" twoowee  "" calls, then closing with a different trill likened to chattering."
Baird's Sparrow,Centronyx bairdii,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,13,"The most common call is a high, week,  "" teep. "" One of the most distinctive sounds of the northern Great Plains, the song of the Baird's Sparrow is a descending series of clear, tinkling notes and ending in a trill. The song lasts up to about 3 seconds."
Bald Eagle,Haliaeetus leucocephalus,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,83.5,"For such a powerful bird, the Bald Eagle emits surprisingly weak-sounding calls—usually a series of high-pitched whistling or piping notes. The female may repeat a single, soft, high-pitched note that has been called 'unlike any other calls in nature'; apparently this signals her readiness for copulation. "
Baltimore Oriole,Icterus galbula,Icteridae,Passeriformes,18,"Both male and female Baltimore Orioles give a staccato chatter during aggressive encounters, such as when trying to drive an intruder out of their nesting area. The chatter call may be heard at any time of day and year. It alerts other orioles nearby and can attract them to help drive away the threat. Both male and female Baltimore Orioles also give a sharp, repetitive  "" chuck "" as an alarm call. Neighboring orioles of various species respond to each others'  "" chuck "" calls. Female Baltimore Orioles give a special, aggressive scream call when defending their nests. The pure, liquid, whistling tones of the male Baltimore Oriole are a herald of springtime in eastern North America. His song consists of a short series of paired notes, repeated 2-7 times, lasting 1-2 seconds. The flutelike sound has a full, rich tone. The male sings to establish and defend a breeding territory, so you won't hear the full song on the wintering grounds. The female Baltimore Oriole also sings. Her shorter songs may be communications with her mate. Occasionally, mated pairs may sing a duet."
Band-tailed Pigeon,Patagioenas fasciata,Columbidae,Columbiformes,36.5,"The male makes mechanical chirping calls while both males and females give a soft, nasal grunt to keep other individuals from crowding too closely. From the top of a tall tree, the male gives a slow series of deep, hooting, almost owl-like coos, each rising slightly in pitch. "
Bank Swallow,Riparia riparia,Hirundinidae,Passeriformes,13,"The typical call, often given during flight, is a harsh, guttural  "" tschr tschr "" . The Bank Swallow song, given by the male during the breeding season for territorial advertisement and courtship, and by females during pair bonding, is a twittery, bubbling chatter."
Barn Owl,Tyto alba,Tytonidae,Strigiformes,36,"Barn Owls don't hoot the way most owls do; instead, they make a long, harsh scream that lasts about 2 seconds. It's made mostly by the male, who often calls repeatedly from the air. Females give the call infrequently. A softer, more wavering version of this is termed a purring call. Males use it to invite a female to inspect a nest site, and females use it to beg for food from the male. Barn Owls also make a loud, 3-4 second hiss at intruders or predators that disturb the nest. "
Barn Swallow,Hirundo rustica,Hirundinidae,Passeriformes,17,"Barn Swallows give a  "" cheep "" call when threatened, and when predators approach too close to a nest site, a  "" churee "" whistle will send adults diving at the threat. In colonies, this call may flush all of the adults from their nests and set them circling above a predator. Males apparently may foil their mate's attempt to copulate with another male by giving a 'fake' alarm call. Both sexes also give an agitated, stuttering call when chasing other Barn Swallows away from nest sites or mates. Both male and female Barn Swallows sing a 'twitter-warble' song during courtship and egg-laying, with a long series of continuous warbling sounds followed by up to a dozen rapid, mechanical-sounding  "" whirr "" s. The song can last 4-20 seconds and is often introduced and followed by a chirp."
Barred Owl,Strix varia,Strigidae,Strigiformes,46.5,"Barred Owls have a distinctive hooting call of 8-9 notes, described as 'Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you-all?' This call carries well through the woods and is fairly easy to imitate. During courtship, mated pairs perform a riotous duet of cackles, hoots, caws and gurgles. Although the Barred Owl is not technically a songbird, its distinctive  "" Who cooks for you? ""  call (see below) functions as a song."
Barrow's Goldeneye,Bucephala islandica,Anatidae,Anseriformes,45.7,"Females traveling to and from the nest often give a low, throaty  "" cuc-cuc-cuc "" call. Courting males give a similar grunting  "" ka-kaa "" during courtship display. In flight, both sexes sometimes give a high-pitched  "" eeee "" . "
Bay-breasted Warbler,Setophaga castanea,Parulidae,Passeriformes,14,"The most commonly heard call note is a high-pitched, buzzy  "" chip "" or  "" sip "" . Males (rarely females) sing a series of up to 10 very high-pitched, sibilant  "" see "" or  "" szee "" or  "" teesi "" notes, on one pitch, difficult to hear at a distance. Early in the breeding season, but not during nesting, the final note of this song is usually accented."
Bell's Sparrow,Artemisiospiza belli,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Both sexes give a distinctive, bell-like  "" tink "" contact call, and use a similar, but more forceful note as an alarm call. The song is an abrupt series of several trills broken up by short chips, lasting about 2 seconds or less. Only males sing, and each male gives one song type which can vary by truncating the last syllables."
Bell's Vireo,Vireo bellii,Vireonidae,Passeriformes,12,"Bell's Vireo has numerous calls. Most often heard is a fast, nasal, scolding alarm call, which sounds wrenlike. Other calls associated with conflict or contact include  "" zip "" ,  "" churt "" ,  "" chim "" , and a high, piercing squeal. The primary song is a hurried, scratchy  "" cheedle cheedle chee? ""  "" cheedle cheedle chew!  "" —easily remembered by its two-part structure, a rising question followed by a definitive answer. Males sing incessantly during the breeding season, females very rarely. Young male Bell's Vireos also give a quiet, rambling version of the song late in the breeding season, almost as if practicing their singing. This is true of many vireo species."
Belted Kingfisher,Megaceryle alcyon,Alcedinidae,Coraciiformes,31.5,"Male and female Belted Kingfishers give strident, mechanical rattles in response to the slightest disturbance. When threatened they may give screams, which males sometimes combine with harsh calls. "
Bendire's Thrasher,Toxostoma bendirei,Mimidae,Passeriformes,24,"Calls include a low, guttural  "" chek, "" recalling the common call of Northern Mockingbird, and an inquisitive-sounding  "" quee "" . Males sing a rich, variable warble made up of repeated elements, with each part repeated 2-4 times. The song has fewer harsh phrases, trills, or whistles than songs of larger thrashers and usually lacks pauses between phrases. Females are not known to sing."
Bewick's Wren,Thryomanes bewickii,Troglodytidae,Passeriformes,13,"Foraging Bewick's Wrens stay in contact with short notes that sound like  "" plink plink "" or  "" pee "" or—from females— "" sker "" . If a male hears another male nearby, he may stop foraging, hurrying to the territorial boundary to chase the interloper away. When agitated, both males and females scold in quick, raspy notes. Immediately before roosting, the male utters series of harsh ( "" spzz "" ) notes. Only the male Bewick's Wren sings, to defend territory and attract mates. Songs vary from one geographical area to another, and a single male may possess a repertoire of 9 to 22 distinct songs. Typically, these begin with two or more high, quick introductory notes, drop into a lower, burry phrase, and end on a high trill. Variations can include additional warbles and buzzy notes. Songs last about 2 seconds."
Bicknell's Thrush,Catharus bicknelli,Turdidae,Passeriformes,16.5,"The most often heard call note is a rather harsh  "" veer "" or  "" queep "" . The nocturnal flight call is similar and generally higher in pitch than that of Gray-cheeked Thrush. Agitated birds on the nesting grounds sometimes give growling or fussing calls. Adults give a soft single or double  "" chuk "" as a contact call. Males (occasionally females) sing a four-phrased, fluting song with a whirling quality. The last phrase rises in pitch (or remains the same in pitch), unlike Gray-cheeked Thrush's song, in which the end phrase falls in pitch. The songs of these two closely related species are otherwise very similar in quality."
Black Guillemot,Cepphus grylle,Alcidae,Charadriiformes,31,"High-pitched, tremulous whistles and staccato piping calls, heard mostly on the breeding grounds. "
Black Oystercatcher,Haematopus bachmani,Haematopodidae,Charadriiformes,44.5,"High-pitched, piping or whistling notes, given singly or in rolling, stuttering, or trilling series, often sounding like an excitable  "" wheee  "" as if given by a kid on a roller coaster. "
Black Phoebe,Sayornis nigricans,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,16,"Black Phoebes give  "" tsip "" calls throughout the year during flight, foraging, and predator interactions. When chasing mates or intruders, they give a  "" tweedle-deedle-eek "" call. During the breeding season males address females with soft, wheezy chatters. Male Black Phoebes sing a long series of repeated  "" tee-hee tee-hoo "" notes to defend territories and attract mates."
Black Rail,Laterallus jamaicensis,Rallidae,Gruiformes,12.5,"The most frequently heard call is a low, growling  "" kerrrr-kerrrr-kerrrr  "" from agitated birds defending the nest or territory. Females disturbed at the nest give a high-pitched series of nasal "" ink "" calls; males tend to give  "" kik "" calls in the same circumstances. Females may also give a Least Bittern-like  "" coo-coo-coo "" and a harsh  "" kik-kik-krrrr "" . Males (and possibly females) give a strange raspy hiss when a predator is near the nest. A barking  "" churt  "" probably serves as a contact call for both sexes. Males usually sing a rolling, froglike  "" kick-ee-kerr  "" (with the last note lower in pitch). Some males add 1-2 short notes at the beginning."
Black Rosy-Finch,Leucosticte atrata,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,15,"Black Rosy-Finches give a buzzy  "" chew "" and a higher-pitched whiny call that sounds like a cross between a House Sparrow and an American Goldfinch.  "
Black Scoter,Melanitta americana,Anatidae,Anseriformes,46,"Courting males give a mournful-sounding, descending whistle,<strong> </strong> "" wheeoooooo "" , and courting females often call in response. Another vocalization is a rattling  "" tuka-tuka-tuka-tuk "" , but this is seldom heard. ""  "" Flight calls described in this species include a low growling sound and a reedy "" tooooo-it "" , sometimes repeated. "
Black Skimmer,Rynchops niger,Laridae,Charadriiformes,45,"The only vocalization is a nasal, yapping bark, given by both sexes in many contexts and often heard from flying birds during bouts of foraging. Males give calls slightly lower in pitch than females. None."
Black Swift,Cypseloides niger,Apodidae,Caprimulgiformes,18.2,"In flight, Black Swifts make a rapid series of twittering chips.  "
Black Tern,Chlidonias niger,Laridae,Charadriiformes,29.5,"A clipped  "" kik i "" s the most commonly heard call. Nesting birds make longer "" kyew "" ,  "" kyew-dik "" , and "" kyew-ki-dik  "" calls. "
Black Turnstone,Arenaria melanocephala,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,23.5,"Year-round, turnstones give high-pitched, stuttering calls that make them easy to locate, even when they are camouflaged among dark rocks. They often call when flushed into flight. Nesting birds give a variety of other purring and trilling calls during courtship, conflict, and chick-rearing. Males vocalize during their display flight, a series of repeated rattling or buzzy calls that ends with a sharp, descending rattle as they come out of the display and land."
Black Vulture,Coragyps atratus,Cathartidae,Cathartiformes,64,"Black Vultures are silent most of the time. They make raspy, drawn-out hissing sounds while feeding and fighting, along with grunting noises that can sound like hungry pigs or dogs barking in the distance. Courting vultures may give a yapping sound. Nestlings give low hisses or coughs to beg for food, and adults at the nest sometimes give creaky, pigeonlike coos. "
Black-and-white Warbler,Mniotilta varia,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12,"Both male and female Black-and-white Warblers give a sharp  "" chit "" or  "" pit "" call, with many variations. Females call to mates when away from the nest, and males may call to mates in order to maintain contact. Males sing a thin, high-pitched, repetitive  "" weesy, weesy, weesy "" song that lasts about 3 seconds. On the breeding grounds, the song may be longer, faster and more varied in pitch.  Males sing a softer version of the song when near females during courtship and nest building."
Black-backed Woodpecker,Picoides arcticus,Picidae,Piciformes,23,"The most often heard call is a sharp, high  "" kyik "" or  "" pik "" . Highly agitated birds give descending 'rattle-snarls,' a very distinctive sound that begins with a high, descending whinny and ends with a mechanical-sounding growl. "
Black-bellied Plover,Pluvialis squatarola,Charadriidae,Charadriiformes,28.5,"The most commonly heard call is the mellow, mournful-sounding flight call, a far-carrying  "" pleeoooee "" , falling and then rising in tone. Males give a piping trill when landing after the aerial display, and males in conflict utter a harsh  "" kleeeeerr "" . Adults disturbed at the nest give a variety of threat and alarm calls. Males sing a burry but musical  "" kooodleeooo "" while displaying, similar to songs of golden-plovers."
Black-bellied Whistling-Duck,Dendrocygna autumnalis,Anatidae,Anseriformes,49,"A soft, high whistle with a long first note and several following notes. They give this call in flight, while standing, or while swimming. They also make a  "" chit-chit-chit "" in flight or a  "" yip "" when taking flight. "
Black-billed Cuckoo,Coccyzus erythropthalmus,Cuculidae,Cuculiformes,29.5,"The call of males and females is a guttural croak that is often preceded by a rapid and harsh chortle.   Males and females sing a staccato series of 3 to 5 toots on the same pitch. They take a brief pause between sets, but can go on repeating sets for several minutes. They sing during, day, night and often while flying overhead. "
Black-billed Magpie,Pica hudsonia,Corvidae,Passeriformes,52.5,"Call a harsh, chattering  "" wock, wock wock-a-wock, wock, pjur, weer, weer. ""  Black-billed Magpies are very vocal birds. Their two primary vocalizations are a harsh, ascending call and a raspy chatter."
Black-capped Chickadee,Poecile atricapillus,Paridae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Chickadees make their  "" chickadee-dee-dee "" call using increasing numbers of  "" dee "" notes when they are alarmed. They also have a gargling call, often given aggressively when a lower-ranking bird gets close to a higher-ranking one; also exchanged between members of a pair. Black-capped Chickadees make a high pitched  "" see "" as a high-intensity alarm call, often when a fast-approaching predator is detected. When chickadees hear this call, they freeze in position until they hear a  "" chickadee-dee "" call signifying 'all clear.' High  "" see "" calls most often given by males. In most of North America, the song is a simple, pure 2 or 3-note whistled  "" fee-bee "" or  "" hey, sweetie "" . In the Pacific Northwest, the song is 3 or 4 notes on the same pitch; the song is also different on Martha's Vineyard in MA. In much of the range, males begin singing in mid-January, and the song increases in frequency as winter progresses. Females also sing occasionally."
Black-capped Vireo,Vireo atricapilla,Vireonidae,Passeriformes,11,"A rapid  "" jidit  "" is the most commonly heard call, amazingly similar to the call of Ruby-crowned Kinglet. Sings an incessant string of rapid, twittering 2- and 3-note phrases, rising and falling in tone, with remarkable variation."
Black-chinned Hummingbird,Archilochus alexandri,Trochilidae,Caprimulgiformes,9,"The Black-chinned Hummingbird has at least five different high-pitched chips and ticks. These are combined in various ways depending on the situation. There are only two published accounts of Black-chinned Hummingbirds singing, both of males near Austin, Texas. These songs were described as 'a sweet and low, though very high-pitched warble, like the sound produced as a result of whistling through the teeth.'"
Black-chinned Sparrow,Spizella atrogularis,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,14.6,"Male and female Black-chinned Sparrows make a high-pitched chip near the nest, when a predator is near and as an alarm call.  The male Black-chinned Sparrow's song sounds very much like a bouncing ping-pong ball. The song starts with 1-5 clear notes, followed by a long accelerating trill. The notes slur into each other as the song gets faster and faster. The trill can end on a higher pitch or a lower pitch, but it always accelerates. "
Black-crested Titmouse,Baeolophus atricristatus,Paridae,Passeriformes,15,"Call a scratchy, chickadee-like  "" tsee-day-day-day. ""  Also fussy scolding notes. Sharper and more nasal than Tufted Titmouse. Song a loud, whistled  "" peew, peew, peew, peew. "" "
Black-crowned Night-Heron,Nycticorax nycticorax,Ardeidae,Pelecaniformes,62,"Black-crowned Night-Herons give a barking squawk when disturbed. Males give a hissing  "" plup "" to attract females. When parents arrive at the nest with food they give a series of guttural notes followed by a raspy  "" woc-a-woc "" call. They also give harsh screams and hoarse clucks. "
Black-footed Albatross,Phoebastria nigripes,Diomedeidae,Procellariiformes,69,"Most common call is a nasal double-bray. Also gives long single notes and growls. Calls are generally lower, louder, and more nasal than those of Laysan Albatross. "
Black-headed Grosbeak,Pheucticus melanocephalus,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,18.5,"The Black-headed Grosbeak's typical call is a sharp  "" spik "" uttered frequently to keep contact with mates while foraging. They utter an upslurring  "" wheet "" upon taking flight. Their distress call is a series of rapidly repeated notes flung out in response to imminent danger to themselves or their chicks, or in violent altercations with other grosbeaks. The Black-headed Grosbeak's whistled song rises and falls like an American Robin's, but it's longer, sweeter, more varied, and less choppy in its phrases. It's sometimes likened to that of a  "" drunk ""  or  "" operatic ""  robin. Both males and females sing. The female's song is usually shorter, simpler, and quieter. She sings less frequently than the male, usually from the nest."
Black-headed Gull,Chroicocephalus ridibundus,Laridae,Charadriiformes,35.5,"Calls harsh and scolding  "" karr ""  and  "" kek. ""  "
Black-legged Kittiwake,Rissa tridactyla,Laridae,Charadriiformes,39.5,"A nasal, repeated  "" kittiwake  "" is the most commonly heard call on the breeding grounds. Also makes other short, nasal calls between mates or between adults and chicks. "
Black-necked Stilt,Himantopus mexicanus,Recurvirostridae,Charadriiformes,37,"Most calls are sharp and rather high-pitched,  "" yap "" ,  "" keek "" , or similar, sometimes doubled and often given in series when alarmed. Quieter versions of the call, heard between adults and young, serve as contact calls.    None."
Black-tailed Gnatcatcher,Polioptila melanura,Polioptilidae,Passeriformes,12,"Both sexes frequently make low, nasal scolds as well as rapid, monotonous successions of harsh notes. Male Black-tailed Gnatcatchers occasionally sing a complex series of jumbled, warbling notes, particularly while defending their territory."
Black-throated Blue Warbler,Setophaga caerulescens,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12,"Males and females give a flat  "" smack "" somewhat reminiscent of the Dark-eyed Junco's call. Males and occasionally females sing a slow-paced series of three to seven buzzy notes, with the last note slurred upward. Some say it sounds like they are saying  "" I am so lazzzy, ""  or  "" please, please, please squeeeeze. ""  They also sing a clearer version of this song with 5 rising and falling notes followed by a rising buzz. Males sing this song during the breeding season from perches in the lower to middle levels of the forest to attract mates. Another song type is 2-6 buzzy notes that rise in pitch at the end. Males often sing the second song type at territorial boundaries or during aggressive encounters. "
Black-throated Gray Warbler,Setophaga nigrescens,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12,"Males and females give a flat  "" chup "" .  Male Black-throated Gray Warblers sing a series of 5-9 buzzy notes; singing  "" zeedle zeedle zeedle zeet-chee "" ."
Black-throated Green Warbler,Setophaga virens,Parulidae,Passeriformes,11.5,"The most common call is a hoarse double chip. In flight, they give a high clear  "" see "" .  Like most warblers, male Black-throated Green Warblers sing two similar songs, one directed at males during territorial interactions, and the other at females. The former, also known as the 'unaccented song,' is a high, cheery-sounding buzz,  "" zee zee zo zo zee "" . The latter,  "" zee zee zee zee zo zee "" , is called the 'accented song' and is sung by males to attract and communicate with female birds."
Black-throated Sparrow,Amphispiza bilineata,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,13,"Black-throated Sparrows give a quiet twittering of jumbled notes that sound like tinkling bells; often during aggressive interactions between males. Females and males also give a high-pitched  "" tink "" .  Males sing a tinkling song from the tops of shrubs or while foraging on the ground. The song starts with two quiet opening notes, slides into a buzz, followed by 2 bell-like notes and a trill.  "
Black-whiskered Vireo,Vireo altiloquus,Vireonidae,Passeriformes,15.5,"Song a broken series of slurred notes, with distinct pauses between the notes. Each phrase usually ends in either a downslur or an upswing, as if the bird asks a question, then answers it, over and over. Call a catbird-like  "" myaah. ""  "
Blackburnian Warbler,Setophaga fusca,Parulidae,Passeriformes,11.5,"Call notes include a high, incisive  "" tseet "" , sometimes doubled, often heard from nesting birds. A thinner, high  "" tsip "" is often heard from migrants during the day. A similar flight call given by nocturnal migrants is a high, very short, sharp  "" tzip. "" The primary song of Blackburnian Warbler is a rapid  "" zip zip zip zip zip zip zip zip titititi tseeeeee "" , with the final note much higher pitched, and so high that many people cannot hear it. A secondary song, rendered  "" teetsa teetsa teetsa teetsa "" , is heard mostly when rival males encounter each other. "
Blackpoll Warbler,Setophaga striata,Parulidae,Passeriformes,14,"Male and females give a loud squeaking chip note. Male Blackpoll Warblers sing a short, high-pitched song made up of a series of staccato notes. The 3-second song gently fades in, increases in volume, and then fades back out. They sound almost like a tiny helicopter approaching and slowly passing,  "" tsit tsit TSIT TSIT tsit tsit "" . Males sing 5-12 notes per second and frequently sing at all hours of the day on the breeding grounds. They also sing a rapid trill song, in which each note blends into the next with less of a staccato sound."
Blue Grosbeak,Passerina caerulea,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,15.5,"Blue Grosbeaks give loud, metallic  "" chink "" calls when disturbed. They also give low, buzzy   "" bzzt "" calls. The male sings a rich, musical warble continuously for 2 or 3 seconds."
Blue Jay,Cyanocitta cristata,Corvidae,Passeriformes,27.5,"Blue Jays make a large variety of calls. The most often heard is a loud  "" jeer "" , Also makes clear whistled notes and gurgling sounds. Blue Jays frequently mimic hawks, especially Red-shouldered Hawks. The Blue Jay vocalization most often considered a song is the 'whisper song,' a soft, quiet conglomeration of clicks, chucks, whirrs, whines, liquid notes, and elements of other calls; a singing bout may last longer than 2 minutes."
Blue-footed Booby,Sula nebouxii,Sulidae,Suliformes,81,"Blue-footed Boobies are seldom heard vocalizing at sea except when squabbling over prey, when they occasionally make guttural braying sounds. Nesting birds give whistling (males) and hoarse quacking (females, young) sounds.  "
Blue-gray Gnatcatcher,Polioptila caerulea,Polioptilidae,Passeriformes,10.5,"Both sexes use high-pitched, nasal calls. A sharp, mewing  "" zeee "" , or  "" chay "" contact call is uttered in bursts of 2 to 6 notes about a second apart. A two note  "" bee-beee "" version of this, with the first note slurred downward, seems to indicate mild agitation. Greater agitation provokes high pitched trills. They use a faster, louder, sharper version of the contact call in aggressive encounters. Mobbing calls are similar to these aggressive calls, but more urgent-sounding. Other calls include high-pitched whistles, a two-note hiccup used by the female during nest site selection, and isolated mimicry of other species. Males have two song types. The simpler is a variable series of 4 to 8 short, soft phrases. This is sung early in the nesting season and, once nesting has begun, shortly after sunrise and in territorial disputes. It may occasionally be sung on wintering grounds. More complex songs are sung from early morning to midday. These continuous jumbles of sharp chips, high-pitched whistles, and mewing notes are 10 seconds or more long and often include mimicked bits from the repertoires of jays, tanagers, towhees, vireos, warblers, sandpipers, and other species. Songs may be sung from elevated perches, while feeding, or while in motion."
Blue-headed Vireo,Vireo solitarius,Vireonidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Fast, repeated scolding and alarm calls vary in intensity and duration but are the most frequent (and distinctive) vocalizations heard from migrants and wintering birds. By keying in on these calls, birders can often discover a mixed flock of birds. Vireos and other birds sometimes respond to imitations of this scolding call. Breeding Blue-headed Vireos also produce a remarkable variety of short calls as well as shrieks, trills, and a nasal  "" nyaa "" . The male sings a querulous song that can be rendered as  "" teeyay "" ,  "" tayah "" ,  "" taweeto "" ,  "" teeaytoay "" ,  "" toowip "" (or 'hear me, see me, hear I am'). The song is similar to several other large vireo songs, but a bit slower than Red-eyed, with each phrase separated by a second or so. "
Blue-throated Mountain-gem,Lampornis clemenciae,Trochilidae,Caprimulgiformes,11.5,"Males often give a clipped  "" chip  "" call, females less often and usually only when defending nest. During courtship, males give a very quiet 'whisper' song lasting up to 8 seconds in the presence of a female. Females respond with a similar song, often as the male is singing. Males' songs differ throughout the species' range and even from canyon to canyon. Males also mark territory for feeding with a long series of loud  "" tseep  "" calls, all on the same pitch, repeated every 1-2 seconds for long periods, usually from an elevated perch. They give this simple, monotonous song for much of the year but especially from March through August in the morning. It is common to be able to hear more than one singing male at a time."
Blue-winged Teal,Spatula discors,Anatidae,Anseriformes,38.5,"Male's call is a loud, high whistle or a nasal bleat. Female gives loud, evenly spaced quacks. "
Blue-winged Warbler,Vermivora cyanoptera,Parulidae,Passeriformes,11.5,"Males and females give a short, quiet  "" chip "" when alarmed or in flight. Females also  "" chip "" during nest building. Blue-winged Warblers sing a raspy  "" bee-buzz "" that sounds like an inhale ( "" bee "" ) and an exhale ( "" buzz "" ). Males also sing a longer high-pitched  "" buzz "" with twittering notes at the start and finish. The primary song acts to acquire a mate, while the secondary song acts to defend territories against rival males. They typically sing the primary song from exposed branches in tall trees or shrubs at the edge of fields and the alternate song from lower down."
Bluethroat,Luscinia svecica,Muscicapidae,Passeriformes,14,"Call a harsh  "" tacc, tacc ""  and a  "" hweet. ""  Song varied, with rich musical notes, hisses, trills, and mimicry of other birds."
Boat-tailed Grackle,Quiscalus major,Icteridae,Passeriformes,31.5,"Boat-tailed Grackles clack or scream at predators and approaching humans. The female makes a chattering call in the breeding season.  "" Chut "" calls are given by either sex before and during flight, and whimpering  "" cheat "" calls are given by amorous males. Boat-tailed Grackles have a variable song with harsh  "" jeeb-jeeb-jeeb "" notes and low-pitched guttural rolls. Both males and females sing, though females do so only rarely."
Bobolink,Dolichonyx oryzivorus,Icteridae,Passeriformes,18,"Bobolinks use a  "" pink "" sound all year round to communicate within flocks, and they have several additional calls during the breeding season. Males give  "" chunk, chenk "" , and  "" see-yew "" calls when disturbed by intruders, buzzes during courtship display, and staccato  "" check "" notes while pursuing other males. Females respond to intruders with  "" chunk "" and  "" quipt "" notes, and use quiet  "" zeep "" notes when conflicting with other individuals. The male sings a metallic, bubbly, rambling song with a mixture of sharp high notes and buzzy low pitches. He sings from perches and in flight throughout the breeding season, but mostly while establishing a territory and courting females. Each male has 2 song types, each composed of 25-50 notes in a fixed sequence, lasting about 3.5 seconds."
Bohemian Waxwing,Bombycilla garrulus,Bombycillidae,Passeriformes,17.5,"The primary call given by Bohemian Waxwings is a high-pitched, rapid, and vibrato trill that sounds similar to a rapid sputtering from a toy laser. Flocks commonly give this call when interacting with each other while perched or in flight. Bohemian Waxwings also give a high-pitched whistled call and a shorter and higher-pitched contact call.  Many songbirds have a song that serves to attract mates and defend territories, but not Bohemian Waxwings, they have no true song. "
Bonaparte's Gull,Chroicocephalus philadelphia,Laridae,Charadriiformes,29,"The most commonly heard call from migrants and wintering birds is a scratchy, grating, ternlike  "" keh "" , sometimes given in series, especially when feeding or in conflict. Nesting birds attacking a predator or territory violator often swoop at their target and utter a long  "" kreeeeeee "" or  "" kakakakakak "" , also recalling a tern. During courtship, and occasionally at other times, the 'long call' is given, but this is not nearly so long as in Herring or other larger gulls, instead being a more staccato, grating  "" kaa-aa-aa-aa-aa  "" that quickens and descends toward the end. Similar but shorter, softer calls are heard from mates at the nest and between parents and young. "
Boreal Chickadee,Poecile hudsonicus,Paridae,Passeriformes,13.25,"The most common call note is a raspy  "" tschick-a-dee-dee "" , harsher than the corresponding call of Black-capped Chickadee. Other calls include a low gargling, a similar twitter or trill, and short, one-syllable chirps, squeals, and short calls "" .  "" The functions of these calls include aggression, courtship, food begging, warning, and alarm. "
Boreal Owl,Aegolius funereus,Strigidae,Strigiformes,24.5,"Males, females, and juveniles give a short  "" kip "" or  "" kew "" year-round.  Male Boreal Owls sing a series of 8-20 low, whistled toots that get progressively louder. Males sing until they find a mate or until the female starts nesting, at which point song frequency decreases to the point of near silence. The song of individuals in North America ('Richardson's') contains more notes and is slower than individuals in Europe ('Tengmalm's'). "
Botteri's Sparrow,Peucaea botterii,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,16,"A quiet, high  "" tsip "" is the most commonly heard call. Song is a well-spaced series of high, thin notes or phrases followed by an accelerating trill with a cadence like a bouncing ping-pong ball coming to rest, often followed by several whistled notes. After females have laid eggs, males sometimes switch to a simpler song. Males sometimes sing a more agitated-sounding song in flight as well."
Brandt's Cormorant,Phalacrocorax penicillatus,Phalacrocoracidae,Suliformes,74.5,"Low, guttural calls sounding like croaks, growls, and gargles. "
Brant,Branta bernicla,Anatidae,Anseriformes,60.7,"Brant give a guttural  "" crrrronk "" when in flocks, both when flying and on the ground. They also have a shorter, sharper  "" cruk "" alarm call "" .  "" Males defending young give a lower, growling  "" gurr  "" or a reedy hiss similar to that of Canada Goose. ""  "" Young goslings give a familiar  "" peep  "" like many other small waterfowl. "
Brewer's Blackbird,Euphagus cyanocephalus,Icteridae,Passeriformes,23,"Brewer's Blackbirds often make a  "" tchup "" or  "" chuk "" similar to the calls of other blackbirds, and used in a manner scientists have called 'conversational in nature.' A more intense, slightly higher pitched version of this call is used as an alarm, to chase off intruders, and when carrying food for young. Males make a clear, descending whistle, about 0.5 second long, when they sight hawks or large birds. Quarreling females chatter at each other with a  "" kit-tit-tit-tit "" call. Both males and females sing two kinds of rather rudimentary songs. The first is a shrill, rising  "" squee "" that lasts about 0.8 second, with a metallic sound. It's reminiscent of the  "" ree "" part of the Red-winged Blackbird's  "" conk-la-ree "" call. The second song is a nonmusical rushing gurgle, also lasting less than a second."
Brewer's Sparrow,Spizella breweri,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,14,"Call is a soft  "" tsip ""  or  "" seep "" , similar to other  "" Spizella "" sparrows. Females give soft twittering calls when soliciting courtship feeding or copulation from males. Male Brewer's Sparrows sing dry, trilling songs that fall into two main types: long and short. Long songs last 10-15 seconds and consist of 5-10 distinct sections. They are quite complex—Roger Tory Peterson once likened it to 'a Chipping Sparrow trying to sing like a canary.' Males sing long songs early in the breeding season when they are trying to attract mates, and generally stop singing the long versions when they have found a mate. After that they sing mostly short songs, which last 1.5 to 3 seconds and typically consist of 2 trilled sections, with the first usually being faster and higher pitched. Some elements of each song type are nearly identical to phrases sung by Clay-colored and Chipping Sparrows. Short songs continue throughout breeding, and sometimes even at night or on the wintering grounds. Songs differ somewhat in quality between the two subspecies, with the sagebrush subspecies being somewhat buzzier than the timberline form."
Bridled Titmouse,Baeolophus wollweberi,Paridae,Passeriformes,10,"A low, rapid, nasal chickadee-like scold is the most commonly heard call. Bridled Titmice give other calls with similar quality in situations of courtship and conflict. Males sing a harsh series of 4-5  "" peeta "" phrases, more rapid and much less musical than the songs of larger titmice species."
Broad-billed Hummingbird,Cynanthus latirostris,Trochilidae,Caprimulgiformes,NA,"A clipped "" je-dit "" , rather similar to the call of a Ruby-crowned Kinglet. Males deliver a series of short  "" chip "" notes when courting females."
Broad-tailed Hummingbird,Selasphorus platycercus,Trochilidae,Caprimulgiformes,8.5,"Males and females chip and chitter when foraging, threatening intruders, or during fights over nectar. "
Broad-winged Hawk,Buteo platypterus,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,39,"Broad-winged Hawks give a plaintive, high-pitched whistle that lasts 2-4 seconds, with a short first note and a long second note:  "" kee-eee "" . The male's call is an octave higher in pitch than the female's. They give this call on the nest and in flight throughout the year. "
Bronzed Cowbird,Molothrus aeneus,Icteridae,Passeriformes,20,"A harsh, low, jay-like "" tchuk. "" Displaying males sing much like Brown-headed Cowbirds but with a burrier quality: a halting series of liquid, rising whistles. They also give a liquid flight-whistle, similar to Brown-headed."
Brown Booby,Sula leucogaster,Sulidae,Suliformes,74.5,"Both sexes are largely silent at sea; they make most vocalizations only at colonies. Males give a high-pitched, wheezy, descending whistle, females a rapid, staccato  "" kaak-kaak-kaak  "" in courtship and a loud roaring scream when defending territory. "
Brown Creeper,Certhia americana,Certhiidae,Passeriformes,13,"Males and females make high, wavering call notes that sound like a small chain being dropped into a heap; these notes are noticeably longer than the very short call notes of many other birds. Creepers give these calls all year long and especially while foraging. Their calls can be hard to distinguish from the calls of Golden-crowned Kinglets. They use other variations of calls during flight, courtship chases, courtship feeding rituals, and aggressive interactions. Only the male sings, and usually only on the breeding grounds, though sometimes during migration as well. His song is a jumble of high, thin notes that lasts up to 1.5 seconds. It's sometimes likened to singing the phrase  "" trees, beautiful trees "" . Creepers may join single songs together two or three times in a row. Although the delicate song carries well through the woods the thin, high notes can be easily missed."
Brown Pelican,Pelecanus occidentalis,Pelecanidae,Pelecaniformes,118.5,"Adults are silent except during wing-jerking displays, which force air from their lungs and produce a low, hoarse sound. Nestlings use a shrill, rasping squawk to beg for food. "
Brown Thrasher,Toxostoma rufum,Mimidae,Passeriformes,26.5,"Their calls consist of one to a few repeated notes, the most common of which sounds like a smacking kiss. Other calls include harsh, slurred, whistles, soft chirrups, and hissing sounds. Brown Thrashers, like catbirds and mockingbirds, are mimics with extremely varied repertoires consisting of more than 1,100 song types.  The male sings a loud, long series of doubled phrases with no definite beginning or end, described by some people as 'plant a seed, plant a seed, bury it, bury it, cover it up, cover it up, let it grow, let it grow, pull it up, pull it up, eat it, eat it.' While mockingbirds tend to repeat phrases three or more times, Brown Thrashers typically sing phrases only twice before moving on. They include somewhat crude imitations of other species in their songs, including Chuck-will's-widow, Northern Flicker, White-eyed Vireo, Tufted Titmouse, Wood Thrush, and Northern Cardinal."
Brown-capped Rosy-Finch,Leucosticte australis,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,15,"Call a buzzy  "" Chew. ""  "
Brown-headed Cowbird,Molothrus ater,Icteridae,Passeriformes,20.5,"Both male and female Brown-headed Cowbirds make a variety of whistles, clicking and chattering calls. You'll often hear flight whistles, which are a series of 2-5 clear sweeping whistles with occasional buzzes or trills mixed in. Females make a distinctive rolling chatter that is very attractive to males. Males give their own chatter calls less often. Both sexes may make a short cluck note while feeding. Male Brown-headed Cowbird sing a liquid-sounding series of low gurgling notes followed by thin sliding whistles, lasting slightly longer than 1 second. Song learning in cowbirds has been an interesting scientific puzzle, since the birds aren't raised by members of their own species."
Brown-headed Nuthatch,Sitta pusilla,Sittidae,Passeriformes,10.5,"In addition to the commonly heard rubber-ducky vocalization, Brown-headed Nuthatches also make a rapid series of high-pitched, jumbled notes, sometimes combined with the rubber-ducky vocalization. During foraging bouts, individuals also make soft single-noted calls—useful for finding groups of nuthatches. Brown-headed Nuthatches don't sing complicated songs, but they are plenty vocal. They make tiny squeaks that sound like a toy rubber ducky being squeezed. These wheezy 2-syllable notes emanate from the treetops year-round. They repeat each squeak 1-12 times. Although not loud by themselves, other members of the group usually join in to amplify the sound."
Buff-bellied Hummingbird,Amazilia yucatanensis,Trochilidae,Caprimulgiformes,10.5,"In aggressive interactions with other Buff-bellied Hummingbirds, gives a rapid series of low notes.  Displaying birds make a two-syllable call. "
Buff-breasted Flycatcher,Empidonax fulvifrons,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,13,"Call a sharp  "" pit. ""  Song a squeaky, musical  "" chee-lick ""  or  "" chee-lick, chou. "" "
Buff-breasted Sandpiper,Calidris subruficollis,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,19,"Usually silent. Makes low trills and shorter, soft  "" chuh  "" or  "" chwup "" calls in flight. No typical song, but males make a quiet ticking sound when courting females."
Bufflehead,Bucephala albeola,Anatidae,Anseriformes,36,"Males often give a grating or chattering call during their head-bobbing courtship displays, and they may squeal or growl in late winter or spring. Females give a guttural  "" cuk-cuk-cuk "" call when circling around potential nest sites. Females also call to their ducklings with a low, throaty note that makes them hurry after her. Bufflehead are quieter than other ducks in their genus. "
Bullock's Oriole,Icterus bullockii,Icteridae,Passeriformes,18,"Both sexes utter a harsh, chattering rattle—sometimes in flight—to signal alarm or maintain contact, or when mobbing or scolding. They also give a sharp one-note call. Bullock's Oriole songs are about 3 seconds long, composed of rich whistled notes interspersed with rattles, often introduced by gruff scratchy notes. The timbre is reminiscent of a child's squeaky-toy. The male's and female's songs are similar in rhythm, pitch, and quality, but the female's final notes are harsher. Females may sing repeatedly from the ground; males usually sing only in trees, often from an inconspicuous perch."
Burrowing Owl,Athene cunicularia,Strigidae,Strigiformes,22,"While Burrowing Owls are capable of producing a variety of cooing, warbling, rasping, clucking, screaming, and rattling sounds, the species is not especially vocal. Most commonly heard is a quail-like two-note cooing made by males during mating and territorial defense. Young owls utter  "" eep "" calls and rasping sounds, the most intense and prolonged of which may scare away predators by mimicking a rattlesnake's warning. "
Bushtit,Psaltriparus minimus,Aegithalidae,Passeriformes,7.5,"Bushtits make several kinds of short, high, wispy contact calls or chip notes. These help group members know where flockmates are. They can intensify to indicate nesting activities or when mobbing predators or confronting opponents. Individuals that get separated from a group make a rapid series of high-pitched chip notes that carries well. Bushtits are active birds that use lots of contact calls, but they don't really have a song. Occasionally, several individuals gathered together make a long, drawn-out series of quiet twitters and chips."
Cackling Goose,Branta hutchinsii,Anatidae,Anseriformes,64,"Noisy. Call a loud honking or a high-pitched, squeaking cackle. "
Cactus Wren,Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus,Troglodytidae,Passeriformes,20,"Adults and fledglings give several types of calls. The  "" tek "" call is a staccato series of notes that adults give to warn intruding wrens. Adults and fledglings also make a single  "" chuck "" sound to communicate with each other. Adults often give a buzz when they see predators. Males make a squeal that sounds like a painful whine when the female takes over the roosting nest to start nesting during the breeding season. Males and females give a growl-like call when they encounter each other, sometimes likened to the sound of a metal rake dragged through loose gravel. The song of the Cactus Wren is a quintessential sound of the desert and sounds like a car that just won't start. Each attempt to start the car lasts for about 4 seconds with a 4-8 second pause before they try again. The raspy, harsh, loud series of harsh  "" char ""  notes, increases slightly in volume and pitch, and the sound carries through the heat of the desert, as far as 1,000 feet away. Females also sing, although their weaker and higher-pitched song is rarely heard. Males sing to attract females and to communicate with their mate and young as well as to warn potential intruders."
California Condor,Gymnogyps californianus,Cathartidae,Cathartiformes,125.5,"Condors are usually silent, but can issue a variety of hisses and snorts particularly when defending nest sites. Newborn chicks hiss, wheeze, and grunt at adults. "
California Gnatcatcher,Polioptila californica,Polioptilidae,Passeriformes,11,"Females and more often males give a call that sounds similar to a kitten's meow. They call year-round, but males tend to call more frequently before and during nest building. During this time, they give around 80 calls per hour. They also scold intruders and predators with a harsh cry or "" mew "" .  "
California Gull,Larus californicus,Laridae,Charadriiformes,50.5,"California Gulls do not have true songs, but they are quite vocal; they cry and carry on even at night on their breeding colonies. Their calls consist of a scratchy, hoarse series of  "" aow ""  and  "" uh-uh-uh ""  notes. They have several types of calls with corresponding unique behaviors including the  "" long call, ""   "" choking call, ""   "" warning call, ""  and  "" alarm call. ""  The  "" long call ""  given during territorial defense starts with their heads lowered and as they raise their heads straight up they bellow out an  "" aow "" . During the  "" choking call ""  they put their breast on the ground and jerk their head up and down as if they were choking while giving a  "" huoh-houh-houh "" . They give the  "" choking call ""  most frequently before and during nest building. The  "" warning call ""  is a long ringing  "" yeow "" , given in flight, especially when they flush from a breeding colony. The  "" alarm call ""  is a series of sharp  "" ha ha ha ha "" notes that they give in flight, often when they detect a predator. Compared to Ring-billed and Herring Gulls, their calls are intermediate in pitch—Ring-billed Gulls are higher pitched and Herring Gulls are lower pitched. "
California Quail,Callipepla californica,Odontophoridae,Galliformes,25.5,"The California Quail's main call consists of three syllables and sounds like the bird is saying  "" Chi-ca-go "" . It's usually given when an individual is separated from its group or mate, as well as while a covey is on the move or preparing to move. The call lasts about 1 second and can be given 10 times or more in succession. California Quail use a repeated  "" pit-pit "" alarm call to alert covey members of nearby danger. Mated California Quail pairs call antiphonally: the male makes short, shrill notes in time with the female's  "" Chi-ca-go "" call. "
California Scrub-Jay,Aphelocoma californica,Corvidae,Passeriformes,29,"California Scrub-Jays, like other jays, are extremely vocal. Behaviorists have described more than 20 separate types of calls for this and the closely related Woodhouse's Scrub-Jay. Examples include a weep uttered during flight, while carrying nesting material, or while taking cover from a flying predator; a bell-like  "" shlenk "" used antagonistically, a quiet  "" kuk "" exchanged between mates, and loud, rasping scolds for mobbing predators. Both males and females sing a soft medley of sweet notes that can last up to 5 minutes. Scrub-jays typically do this only during courtship and when the pair is close together."
California Thrasher,Toxostoma redivivum,Mimidae,Passeriformes,32,"Both sexes give a low  "" chup "" call that is often heard, as well as a rising  "" churreep  "" and harsher  "" chak. "" Males sing a series of twice-repeated phrases with 2-3 syllables each, usually with a sweet quality, often including imitations of other bird species around them, including California Quail, Wrentit, California Scrub-Jay, Bewick's Wren, Nuttall's Woodpecker, Spotted Towhee, and Lesser Goldfinch. Females sometimes join males in song, and their songs are of similar type and volume."
California Towhee,Melozone crissalis,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,23,"The most frequently heard sound from California Towhees is a clear, metallic chip, similar to the sound of a Northern Cardinal (and also to the California ground squirrel). Males and females may call intermittently or in a monotonous string of chips every couple of seconds. When birds are alarmed, the chipping rate may triple. Mated pairs often face each other and give a rapid series of squeals and squeaks; this call is an important part of reinforcing the pair bond. The song is given only by male California Towhees and is made up of repetitions of the bird's metallic chip note. Songs typically start with a few well-spaced notes that rapidly accelerate into a trill and then stop abruptly. The whole song typically lasts 1-2 seconds."
Calliope Hummingbird,Selasphorus calliope,Trochilidae,Caprimulgiformes,8.5,Like other hummingbirds they chip while foraging and during encounters with other birds. Male Calliope Hummingbirds emit a high pitched zing that sounds a bit like a sharp knife cutting quickly through the air during their display dives. 
Canada Goose,Branta canadensis,Anatidae,Anseriformes,93,"Various loud honks, barks, and cackles. Also some hisses. "
Canada Jay,Perisoreus canadensis,Corvidae,Passeriformes,27,"Canada Jays have a wide array of calls from harsh chatters to clear whistles, though they are much less vocal than other jays and crows. They can imitate the calls of their predators, including Northern Pygmy-Owls, Rough-legged Hawks, Merlins, Pine Grosbeaks, Red-tailed Hawks, Broad-winged Hawks, American Crows, and Blue Jays. This mimicry may confuse the predator or signal a threat to other Canada Jays. Canada Jays sing a 'whisper song,' a series of soft melodious notes interspersed with quiet clicks, lasting up to a minute."
Canada Warbler,Cardellina canadensis,Parulidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Males and females give a short, flat chip.  Canada Warblers sing a clear and loud song that starts with a chip, followed by a series of warbling notes that often ends on a higher pitch. Songs of individuals are highly variable; they have the same general Canada Warbler quality, but the order and pace of notes change. Males are the primary songsters, but female song was reported in one instance. Males sing around 6 songs per minute when they are looking for a mate. They generally sing from a low perch within their territory. "
Canvasback,Aythya valisineria,Anatidae,Anseriformes,52,"Canvasbacks are generally silent. Males make soft cooing sounds and females give a guttural  "" krrr-krrr "" during courtship. Nonbreeding birds make a wheezing call when other Canvasbacks approach a feeding area. Females sometimes quack when taking flight.  "
Canyon Towhee,Melozone fusca,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,23,"The typical Canyon Towhee call note is a low-pitched, two-parted  "" she-dup "" . Mated pairs also make a high, thin  "" seep "" note to stay in touch with each other or in alarm, and nestlings that hear this note go quiet. A foraging pair periodically comes together and exchanges a string of these  "" seep "" notes while facing each other, bobbing their heads, and fluffing feathers. A typical Canyon Towhee song consists of 6-8 repeated, two-parted syllables, sounding like  "" chili-chili-chili "" , lasting 1-2 seconds and often introduced by a call note. Within this basic structure there are many variations in the pattern and tempo."
Canyon Wren,Catherpes mexicanus,Troglodytidae,Passeriformes,13.4,"A scratchy-sounding  "" tsee "" . Subtle variations of this call probably serve as contact and alarm calls. When a male sings, the female partner often begins a series of calls during his song, in duet. Both male and female sing, a lovely series of sweet, liquid notes that descends and slows, trailing off in a series of doubled notes, often finished with a mewling call note or two. Female songs are often shorter and less rich sounding than male songs. Males sometimes sing in winter."
Cape May Warbler,Setophaga tigrina,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"The most commonly heard call is a short, incisive, high-pitched "" tsip "" . A similar flight call is given by nocturnal migrants. Other reported call types include a descending  "" tsee "" in flight or while feeding; a short  "" prssp "" ; and  "" tzee "" as well as dry ticking notes in conflict and during chases. Males sing a series of 3­-8 thin, very high-pitched  "" tseet "" notes, all on the same pitch; very similar to song of Bay-breasted Warbler. A secondary song is similar but uses doubled notes, recalling the primary song of Black-and-white Warbler. Females have not been reported to sing."
Carolina Chickadee,Poecile carolinensis,Paridae,Passeriformes,11,"The Carolina Chickadee's version of the  "" chickadee-dee-dee "" is more rapid than the comparable sound produced by Black-capped Chickadees. Carolina Chickadees also produce a wide variety of gargles and raspy notes. A very high-pitched  "" seee "" warns of falcons or accipiters flying over. Often a four-note whistle. One pattern is  "" fee-bee-fee-bay "" with first and third notes higher in pitch, but at least 35 other songs heard."
Carolina Wren,Thryothorus ludovicianus,Troglodytidae,Passeriformes,13,"Carolina Wrens have a large repertoire of calls, including loud repeated rasping, chattering, and a rising and falling  "" cheer. "" Only male Carolina Wrens sing—a series of several quick, whistled notes, repeated a few times. The entire song usually lasts less than 2 seconds and the notes are usually described as three-parted, as in a repeated  "" teakettle "" or  "" germany "" . Each male has a repertoire of up to several dozen different song variations. He'll sing one of these about 15 times before changing his tune."
Caspian Tern,Hydroprogne caspia,Laridae,Charadriiformes,50.5,"Call a raspy  "" kowk. ""  Juvenile begging call a high pitched whistling; heard frequently during migration and in winter. "
Cassia Crossbill,Loxia sinesciuris,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,NA,"Cassia Crossbills give a short kip in flight that serves to keep the group together. The call differs slightly from Red Crossbill type 2 and type 5 calls, but hearing the difference is challenging. Cassia's call (Type 9) is a bit lower in pitch and has a harsher quality to it. The best way to separate them is to look at the shape of the call on a spectrogram. Each Cassia Crossbill call consists of an upside-down U followed by a slash. More detailed information on crossbill call types is on <a href= "" http://ebird.org/content/ebird/news/crossbills-of-north-america-species-and-red-crossbill-call-types/ "" >eBird</a>. Their excitement calls, often given as an alarm call or in response to aggressive flock mates also differ from Red Crossbill types 2 and 5. Cassia Crossbill's excitement call rises and then falls in pitch unlike Red Crossbill type 5, which doesn't rise and fall as much and unlike Red Crossbill type 2, which starts lower in pitch and then rises and falls. The Cassia Crossbill sings a jumbling warble much like other crossbills, but its song is a bit buzzier with more repetition. "
Cassin's Auklet,Ptychoramphus aleuticus,Alcidae,Charadriiformes,23,Generally silent at sea. Makes loud creaking call at colony. 
Cassin's Finch,Haemorhous cassinii,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,16,"Both males and females give distinctive, liquid calls with two or three syllables. The male makes a loud call as he returns from foraging to perch near the nest tree, and the female responds to the call of her mate, ignoring the calls of other males. Male Cassin's Finches sing a rollicking, warbling song with a fast series of short syllables. Their songs often include obvious and quite skilled imitations of other bird species. They sing from perches, in flight, and even while mating. Males sing to attract females in the spring, but they don't seem to defend territories through song."
Cassin's Kingbird,Tyrannus vociferans,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,22,"Both sexes, but mostly males, give a quick, emphatic  "" ti-bew "" or higher  "" chi-queer "" , one of the more distinctive sounds of western landscapes. During territorial conflicts, males also give an incisive, shrill  "" ki-dear, ki-dear, ki-dear "" . Males vocalize before and through dawn with what many birders call a 'dawn song.' These vocalizations have tremendous variation, even in a single bird, and are used to attract a mate and to mark territory. The typical song is a series of scratchy, rolling notes that rise in pitch and emphasis at the end, lasting around 3 seconds."
Cassin's Sparrow,Peucaea cassinii,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,14,"A very high-pitched, rising  "" psit "" . The primary song is a whistled melody, beginning with two short introductory notes, followed by a rich, fluting trill and two lower final notes. As do many other sparrow species, Cassin's also has a 'complex' song that resembles the primary song but is preceded by series of chips and buzzy notes. Courting adults often give a buzzy twitter call when chasing or displaying over the territory."
Cassin's Vireo,Vireo cassinii,Vireonidae,Passeriformes,12.3,"Among the most often heard vocalizations outside the breeding season are harsh, raspy alarm calls ( "" cha-cha-cha-cha "" ) that vary in intensity and duration. Cassin's Vireo's calls sound very similar to the calls of other vireos but are useful to learn, as they often attract other bird species. The male sings a halting, burry song of ascending and descending phrases. There can be 1 second or more of silence between each phrase, and the overall song can go on for long periods. Plumbeous Vireo songs are almost identical but the first phrases of its song are less burry than in Cassin's."
Cattle Egret,Bubulcus ibis,Ardeidae,Pelecaniformes,51,"Cattle Egrets give raspy, repeated 'rick-rack' calls throughout the year at the nest and the roost. Their repertoire also includes harsh 'raa' calls to defend the nest and chatter calls to greet their mates. They are usually quiet while foraging and flying. "
Cave Swallow,Petrochelidon fulva,Hirundinidae,Passeriformes,14,"Cave Swallows chatter in flight with a high-pitched  "" zreet "" that they repeat multiple times.  Cave Swallows sing a series of squeaks, complex warbles, gurgles, and knocks that lasts for about 6 seconds. The song tends to lack the static-like sounds of Cliff Swallows. "
Cedar Waxwing,Bombycilla cedrorum,Bombycillidae,Passeriformes,15.5,"Cedar Waxwings have two common calls: a high-pitched, trilled  "" bzeee "" and a sighing whistle, about a half-second long, often rising in pitch at the beginning. Cedar Waxwings call often, especially in flight. "
Cerulean Warbler,Setophaga cerulea,Parulidae,Passeriformes,11,"Males and females commonly give a metallic buzzy  "" zeet "" , likely to keep in touch with their mate. They also give this call during flight. A second call is a sharp chip given as an alarm call.  Male Cerulean Warblers sing a buzzy song that ascends to a buzzy trill. The song starts with 3 buzzy notes, followed by 4 fast warbles, and ends with a higher pitched buzzy trill. They sing from canopy perches, often in bitternut hickories and white oaks. "
Chestnut-backed Chickadee,Poecile rufescens,Paridae,Passeriformes,11,"The main call of the Chestnut-backed Chickadee is a high, thin, scratchy  "" chick-a-dee "" , 1-1.5 seconds long. The number of  "" dee "" notes is variable, but typically fewer than in the Black-capped Chickadee's call. The Chestnut-backed Chickadee's other common call is the gargle, a jumble of short clicks often dropping in pitch and ending on a longer note. The whole call lasts about a second. It's typically used to defend territories or to signal aggression by birds in a flock. Chestnut-backed Chickadees don't have the clear-whistled  "" fee-bee "" song that most other chickadees use. Instead it has a song, given rarely, that consists of a series of 'gargle' calls."
Chestnut-collared Longspur,Calcarius ornatus,Calcariidae,Passeriformes,14.75,"Chestnut-collared Longspurs give a buzzy contact call,  "" tzip, "" during aggressive interactions with other longspurs. They also commonly make a finchlike  "" til-lip  "" contact call.  Male Chestnut-collared Longspurs sing both during the flight display and while perched. The song is a sweet, descending warble with various gurgling pitch changes, lasting about 2 seconds. "
Chestnut-sided Warbler,Setophaga pensylvanica,Parulidae,Passeriformes,13,"The most commonly heard call is a rich, sweet  "" chip "" , recalling that of Yellow Warbler. Males sing two songs. The song most often heard is a short ditty often described as  "" Pleased, pleased, pleased to meetcha! "" or  "" I wish to meet Miss Beecher ""  "" ! "" This song ends with a decisive accented ending, indicated by the exclamation mark. The other song is similar but lacks this emphatic ending, and as a result sounds much more like the typical song of a Yellow Warbler. Males sing the accented song more often while trying to attract a female. Later in the nesting season they switch and sing unaccented song more often."
Chihuahuan Raven,Corvus cryptoleucus,Corvidae,Passeriformes,49.5,"A  "" caw  "" similar to the call of American Crow but longer and lower in pitch. "
Chimney Swift,Chaetura pelagica,Apodidae,Caprimulgiformes,13.5,"Chimney Swifts give a fast, twittering series of high-pitched chip notes, about 3 seconds long. In flight the chips can be so close together that they become a buzzy, insect-like twitter. In other situations the chips can be spaced nearly a half-second apart. "
Chipping Sparrow,Spizella passerina,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Year round, both sexes use a single chip note to stay in contact with others. Upon sighting a hawk, Chipping Sparrows give a long  "" zeeeee "" call as an alarm. During courtship, females make a soft, rapid  "" see-see-see-see "" to attract the attention of her mate. Male Chipping Sparrows sing a long, dry trill of evenly spaced, almost mechanical-sounding chips. It's one of the most common sounds of open woods in spring - but be careful, because Dark-eyed Juncos sound very similar (though a bit more musical) and often live in the same habitats. Songs are about 3.6 seconds long on average, consisting of around 55 nearly identical chip notes in a row."
Chuck-will's-widow,Antrostomus carolinensis,Caprimulgidae,Caprimulgiformes,30," Song a loud  "" Chuck-will's-widow, ""  with the first  "" chuck ""  being quiet and inaudible at a distance."
Chukar,Alectoris chukar,Phasianidae,Galliformes,36,"Chukars are vocal birds with a handful of calls used for social contact, aggressive or sexual behavior, or when alarmed. The most common vocalization is a loud and raspy call that starts with a low intensity  "" chuck "" , intensifies to a louder  "" chukar "" , and ends with a slower 3 syllable  "" chuck-a-ra "" . Males and females give their namesake call to keep track of each other, and males use it during the breeding season to keep other males out of their territory. When startled they give a loud piercing scream as they flush. "
Cinnamon Teal,Spatula cyanoptera,Anatidae,Anseriformes,40.599999999999994,"Males in conflict or courtship make a rattling, low-pitched  "" karr karr karr "" , and receptive females give a quieter  "" rrrr "" . Like many female dabbling ducks, Cinnamon Teal females give a short quack and a 'decrescendo call,' a relatively brief  "" gack-gack-ga-ga. "" No song."
Clapper Rail,Rallus crepitans,Rallidae,Gruiformes,36.5,Call a short series of clacking or grunting notes. 
Clark's Grebe,Aechmophorus clarkii,Podicipedidae,Podicipediformes,65,"Clark's Grebe produces many vocalizations during the breeding season but is largely silent in winter. The advertising call, which commences the rushing display, is a harsh  "" creet— "" a single note rather than the double note typical of Western Grebe. As in that species, the advertising call is soon followed by a harsh trill known as a 'ratchet call.' Females soliciting food from mates give a repeated  "" tuk-a "" , and males give a loud trill during copulation. Both sexes deliver a  "" tuk-tuk-tuk "" , a threat call directed at rivals during ​establishment of the nest site. No song."
Clark's Nutcracker,Nucifraga columbiana,Corvidae,Passeriformes,28.5,"Like other members of the crow family, the Clark's Nutcracker doesn't have any true songs, but it has a large repertoire of calls. It makes grating, metallic  "" kraak "" s to maintain contact with other nutcrackers, it squalls when disturbed, and it makes a froglike croak that may be part of pair-bonding. On the more musical end of the spectrum, family members communicate with low, melodious calls that rise in pitch. "
Clay-colored Sparrow,Spizella pallida,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,NA,"Simple  "" tsip "" notes are repeated on many occasions, including communication between mates, parent to offspring, and among members of a flock. When the birds are alarmed, this note intensifies to a louder, sharper chip. The male's song is a very simple repetition of 2 to 8 low, drawn-out buzzes lasting about 2 seconds in all. It sounds very insectlike."
Cliff Swallow,Petrochelidon pyrrhonota,Hirundinidae,Passeriformes,13,"Their most common call is a soft  "" chur "" . They also give a squeak when foraging and a purr-like alarm call when predators approach the colony. While courting and nesting, Cliff Swallows sing a series of guttural grating sounds and squeaks, usually lasting up to 6 seconds."
Common Eider,Somateria mollissima,Anatidae,Anseriformes,60.55,"Calls hoarse, grating and cooing sounds. "
Common Gallinule,Gallinula galeata,Rallidae,Gruiformes,33.5,"Common Gallinules make all sorts of chickenlike clucks, whinnies, cackles, squawks, and yelps. They often call while hidden from view, leaving you wondering what lurks in the marsh. The rapid series of clucks sounds vaguely raptorlike, but the series often ends with what sounds like a laugh. Their squawks can be low-pitched and grating or high-pitched and piercing. They tend to mix and match calls, throwing in a squawk or cluck after a cackle or vice versa. They are more vocal during the breeding season from April-June.  "
Common Goldeneye,Bucephala clangula,Anatidae,Anseriformes,45.5,"Despite their scientific species name ( "" clangula "" , or 'screaming') Common Goldeneyes are usually silent. Males give a single, short, faint  "" peent "" as part of several courtship displays and a grunting sound following copulation. Females give a harsh, croaking  "" gack "" when disturbed. When circling a lake or prospecting for nest sites, females sometimes make a series of short  "" cuk "" calls. "
Common Grackle,Quiscalus quiscula,Icteridae,Passeriformes,31,"Males and females make a very short, harsh  "" chaa "" or  "" chitip "" call when alarmed, taking flight, or approaching other grackles. Males make a distinctive, short, nasal call while perching in a nesting colony. Common Grackles make a variety of squeaks, whistles, and croaks. The typical song, made by both males and females, is a guttural  "" readle-eak "" accompanied by high-pitched, clear whistles. It lasts just less than a second and is often described as sounding like a rusty gate."
Common Ground Dove,Columbina passerina,Columbidae,Columbiformes,16.5,"Males give a short guttural squawk during the courtship display. Males and females may squawk when jockeying for position at food or water sources. Both males and females make a repeated, high-pitched coo, heard year-round at all hours of the day. Each sequence of coos contains 1-13 rising notes, and a sequence may be repeated 4-5 times per minute for many minutes on end. Ground-doves use variations of this song while courting, while waiting for a mate to return, and when flushing from a nest."
Common Loon,Gavia immer,Gaviidae,Gaviiformes,78.5,"Common Loons are famous for their eerie, beautiful calls. Among these are the tremolo, a wavering call given when a loon is alarmed or to announce its presence at a lake. The yodel is the male loon's territorial claim. Each male has his own signature yodel. If a male moves to a different territory, he will change his yodel. The wail is the haunting call that loons give back and forth to figure out each other's location. Hoots are soft, short calls given to keep in contact with each other. Parents might hoot to a chick, or one mate might hoot to another. "
Common Merganser,Mergus merganser,Anatidae,Anseriformes,62.5,"Common Mergansers are usually silent, but females make a high, rapid  "" cro cro cro "" to call ducklings from the nest, and give harsh  "" gruk "" calls when threatened by predators. Males give hoarse calls when alarmed and bell-like or twanging calls during courtship. "
Common Murre,Uria aalge,Alcidae,Charadriiformes,40.5,"Generally silent at sea, makes gutteral  "" urr ""  at colony. "
Common Nighthawk,Chordeiles minor,Caprimulgidae,Caprimulgiformes,23,"Common Nighthawks give a nasal  "" peent "" or  "" beer "" call while flying. When defending a nest, the female gives a hissing or throaty cluck. Courting males give a croaking  "" auk auk auk "" call. "
Common Pauraque,Nyctidromus albicollis,Caprimulgidae,Caprimulgiformes,29," Song a loud burry whistle,  "" purr-WEEE-eer. "" "
Common Poorwill,Phalaenoptilus nuttallii,Caprimulgidae,Caprimulgiformes,20,"Birds that have been disturbed give growling, barking, and hissing calls. The male's song during the breeding season is a repeated, whistled  "" poorwillip "" . This gives the species its name, as the final syllable is difficult to hear at any distance."
Common Raven,Corvus corax,Corvidae,Passeriformes,62.5,"Common Ravens make many different kinds of calls varying from a low, gurgling croak to harsh grating sounds and shrill alarm calls. Scientists have placed their vocalizations into as many as 33 different categories based on sound and context. The most commonly heard is the classic gurgling croak, rising in pitch and seeming to come from the back of the throat. It's much deeper and more musical than a crow's simple, scratchy caw. Ravens make this call often. It's audible for more than a mile, and ravens often give it in response to other ravens they hear in the distance. Among their other calls, ravens make short, repeated, shrill calls when chasing predators or trespassers, and deep, rasping calls when their nests are disturbed. Dominant females sometimes make a rapid series of 12 or so loud knocking sounds that lasts about a second. Common Ravens can mimic other birds, and when raised in captivity can even be taught words. "
Common Redpoll,Acanthis flammea,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,13,"Common Redpolls form vocal, chattering flocks characterized by three main calls: a chatter of several sharp, zapping notes; a nasal, rising whistle lasting nearly half a second, and a rattle or trill that lasts nearly a second. Redpoll songs are mainly a combination of their call notes given in a long string, lasting up to half a minute."
Common Tern,Sterna hirundo,Laridae,Charadriiformes,34.5,"Terns are vocal birds with a variety of harsh, burry, and shrill calls. In flight or in territorial disputes they give a down-slurred burry and nasal call. When they are alarmed or threatened by other terns they give a grating "" kee-ar "" . They also give a sharp  "" kip "" often when feeding in a flock or when taking off from a colony.  "
Common Yellowthroat,Geothlypis trichas,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12,"Both males and females give a strong  "" chuck "" when potential predators approach. Males give an aggressive chatter call when other males are singing, and females give a fast series of chipping notes when they're ready to mate. The male sings a distinctive  "" witchety-witchety-witchety "" song, about 2 seconds long, to defend the territory and attract females. They give these songs very frequently during summer, averaging as high as 125 songs per hour and sometimes reaching 300 songs per hour."
Connecticut Warbler,Oporornis agilis,Parulidae,Passeriformes,14,"Call a soft  "" witch. ""  Song a loud, ringing  "" chippy-chuppy, chippy-chuppy, chippy-chuppy, ""  being most emphatic in the middle."
Cooper's Hawk,Accipiter cooperii,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,38,"Outside of the breeding season, Cooper's Hawks tend to be silent. The most common call is a loud, grating  "" cak-cak-cak "" , 2-5 seconds long, given by both sexes in defense of the nest. This call is also given during courtship. Males frequently make a  "" kik "" call to tell their mates where they are; females make this call too, but less often. Females make a  "" whaa "" call when approaching or receiving food from males. "
Cordilleran Flycatcher,Empidonax occidentalis,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,15.5,"Call is a sharp  "" seet! ""  Song high-pitched, squeaky, three-part  "" ps-SEET, ptsick, seet! "" "
Costa's Hummingbird,Calypte costae,Trochilidae,Caprimulgiformes,NA,"Females call with a sharp, dry tic when foraging or flying, but males rarely call. They call singly or give a series of tics. Males sing a thin, high-pitched whistle when perched and when performing a looping dive. From a perch, a male whistles 4 short and thin notes less than 1 second long. During his looping dive, his whistle rises and falls in pitch for about 2.5 seconds."
Couch's Kingbird,Tyrannus couchii,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,22,"Both sexes make a quick  "" kip "" and a harsh, grating  "" queer  "" or  "" chi-queer.  "" Males give a longer  "" tzeeeeerr  "" call. Males sing a burry series of  "" peer  "" notes interspersed with querulous notes or shap  "" pit "" s, very different from the twittering songs of Tropical Kingbirds. Most often heard from nesting birds, both at the end of the day and before dawn (and often called  "" dawn song. "" )"
Crested Caracara,Caracara cheriway,Falconidae,Falconiformes,53.5,"Crested Caracaras are mostly silent, but when disturbed, they occasionally make a hollow rattling that sounds similar to running a stick along a fence. They throw their heads back, lifting their bills to the sky while giving a rattle. They tend to be more vocal during the breeding season.  "
Crissal Thrasher,Toxostoma crissale,Mimidae,Passeriformes,30,"Call note a  "" pitchoree. ""  Song is a long series of rich, warbled, variable phrases."
Curve-billed Thrasher,Toxostoma curvirostre,Mimidae,Passeriformes,27.5,"The  "" whit-wheet "" , or double whistle, sometimes described as the whistle of someone hailing a taxi, is the most common call. Other calls, usually heard during the nesting season, include a wrenlike fuss and a low  "" chuk "" . Curve-billed Thrashers sing a pleasant, highly variable ditty composed of repeated notes in short, often staccato phrases, some soft but many sounding more grating or harsh. In the eastern population, singing Curve-billeds regularly include imitations of other songbirds' calls."
Dark-eyed Junco,Junco hyemalis,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,15,"Juncos have a high, short chip note that they often give in rapid succession when they fly and more slowly as they forage; the note may encourage other juncos to follow. A sharp but musical  "" kew "" seems to indicate aggression and encourages two birds to move apart; it's usually given by the dominant bird. You may also hear juncos give a high, fast twittering call of 6-19 notes during altercations or as birds flush. Male Dark-eyed Juncos sing an even, musical trill of 7-23 notes that lasts up to 2 seconds. It's similar to the songs of both the Chipping Sparrow and the Pine Warbler, and is loud enough to be heard from several hundred feet away. Both sexes sing a much quieter song as well, a series of whistles, trills, and warbles that may sound like an American Goldfinch. This song typically doesn't carry any farther than about 40 feet."
Dickcissel,Spiza americana,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,15,"The typical Dickcissel call note is a dry  "" chek.  "" The distinctive flight call is a buzzer-like  "" pzzzt.  "" While there can be a fair amount of variation among Dickcissel songs, the basic song is a simple, buzzy  "" dick-dick-see-see-see,  "" from whence the bird gets its name. "
Double-crested Cormorant,Phalacrocorax auritus,Phalacrocoracidae,Suliformes,80,"The Double-crested Cormorant makes deep, guttural grunts that sound a bit like an oinking pig. They grunt when taking off or landing, or during mating or aggressive displays, but otherwise are generally silent. "
Dovekie,Alle alle,Alcidae,Charadriiformes,21,"Dovekies are silent at sea and seldom heard by bird watchers except at their breeding colonies, where pairs give calls including a high-pitched chattering trill; a soft, low clucking; a hoarse purring; and a snarling sound. Single birds that have been alarmed give a single high  "" weep "" call or a whinnying sound. "
Downy Woodpecker,Dryobates pubescens,Picidae,Piciformes,15.5,"The Downy Woodpecker's whinnying call, made by both sexes, is a typical sound of deciduous forests during the breeding season. It's a somewhat excited string of hoarse, high-pitched notes that descend in pitch toward the end; the call lasts about 2 seconds. Excited birds also give a very sharp  "" pik "" note, occasionally repeated several times. "
Dunlin,Calidris alpina,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,19,"The most commonly heard call is a high-pitched, scratchy  "" krree "" , given by birds in flight or in conflict. The song, heard mostly from males on the breeding grounds, often during display flights, is a remarkable series of highly modulated (burry) trills, beginning with a short set of lower notes that each rises in pitch, then finishing with a descending trill that recalls a movie sound-effect for a spaceship landing. The song can last 3.5 seconds."
Dusky Flycatcher,Empidonax oberholseri,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,14.1,"A dry, soft but distinct  "" whit  "" is the most commonly heard call year-round. On the breeding grounds, both sexes give a distinctive  "" du-hic "" call, the  "" du "" a mellow whistle following by a sharp, rising  "" hic "" . Seven other call types, including trills and rattles, are heard mostly on the breeding grounds. The song is short and three-parted. It begins with a rising  "" prll-it "" , followed by a husky  "" prrdrrt "" , and ends with a clear, high-pitched  "" pseet.  "" The last element of the song is clearly higher in pitch than the last element of Hammond's Flycatcher's song. The whole song lasts just over a second. Patient listening will reveal that most males frequently mix up the order of these elements."
Dusky Grouse,Dendragapus obscurus,Phasianidae,Galliformes,50.5,"Males advertise their territory with a series of very low-pitched, quiet hoots. Though these are quiet and easy to miss, they can carry for more than 100 feet. Because this vocalization is given repeatedly to mark territory and attract females, some researchers refer to it as 'song.' Males also give a growling  "" gugugug "" or more staccato  "" cak-cak-cak "" when confronting rivals or other intruders, including humans. Females give a quavering cackle or whinny to show interest to advertising males. In aggressive encounters, females give a hiss or chickenlike cluck. Females stay in contact with chicks using a quiet  "" tu "" , sometimes repeated. If separated from her brood, hens give loud, high-pitched  "" skree "" ,  "" kweer-kweer,  "" and "" kwa-kwa "" calls. "
Eared Grebe,Podiceps nigricollis,Podicipedidae,Podicipediformes,32.5,"Males and females give an advertising call that starts with a single note and ends with a hiccup. The female's advertising call is higher pitched and slightly shorter than the male's call. Both sexes also give thin trills during courtship and copulation. At colonies with multiple birds calling, the sound is similar to a frog chorus at dusk. When alarmed they give a single sharp chirp. Outside of the breeding season, they are generally quiet.  "
Eastern Bluebird,Sialia sialis,Turdidae,Passeriformes,18.5,"The Eastern Bluebird's most common call is a soft, low-pitched  "" tu-a-wee "" with a querulous tone. The call lasts a little less than a second, with males' calls typically slightly longer than females'. Bluebirds give this song in all seasons as a way of keeping in touch with each other or to signal nestlings that adults are bringing food. When bluebirds get too close to each other, they let each other know with a single, harsh screech. Females make a very soft, low chip when a courting male approaches. Birds nervous at the approach of a ground predator make a loud, continual  "" chit-chit-chit "" . Eastern Bluebirds sing a fairly low-pitched, warbling song made up of several phrases, each consisting of 1-3 short notes. Harsher chattering notes may be interspersed with the whistles. The whole song lasts about 2 seconds. Typically, unpaired males sing this song from a high perch or sometimes in flight, as they try to attract a mate. Females sometimes sing this song when they see predators on their territory. Paired males sometimes sing a much softer version of this song while females are laying eggs."
Eastern Kingbird,Tyrannus tyrannus,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,21,"Males vocalize more than females, but both give a variety of high-pitched, short, explosive calls with an electric quality. Male Eastern Kingbirds sing a complex vocalization from perches before dawn or occasionally in the evening. This sound consists of high, sputtering notes followed by a buzzy  "" zeer "" , repeated many times, with each song lasting about 1.5 seconds."
Eastern Meadowlark,Sturnella magna,Icteridae,Passeriformes,22.5,"Eastern Meadowlarks give a single, sharp  "" dzert "" note when humans or other meadowlarks intrude on their territory. Another distinctive sound is a harsh chatter that lasts 1.5 seconds and is given by both males and females. Both sexes have a series of  "" weet "" calls that they give while in flight. The male Eastern Meadowlark's primary song consists of 3 to 5 (sometimes up to 8) pure and plaintive flutelike whistles all slurred together and gradually dropping in pitch, up to 2 seconds long. Male have a repertoire of songs, singing one song repeatedly for a time and then switching to a different version. They typically sing from an exposed perch, but occasionally sing in flight as well."
Eastern Phoebe,Sayornis phoebe,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,15.5,"Both sexes also use a soft chip note to communicate. Males hovering at a possible nest site to show it to a female also give a nasal chattering call. Males sing a raspy, two-parted song that gives them their name:  "" fee-bee.' It lasts about half a second. They also sing a variant of this song with a stutter or two between the two syllables; this is more often heard during or after aggressive interactions."
Eastern Screech-Owl,Megascops asio,Strigidae,Strigiformes,20.5,"Among the Eastern Screech-Owl's many calls are soft, low hoots; loud, sharp barking calls that indicate alarm or agitation; and, true to their name, screeches—typically given by adults defending nests or fledglings. A three- or four-note chuckle or rattle denotes annoyance, as when a bird is being mobbed. Both males and females sing. Their most common sounds are an even-pitched trill, often called a 'bounce song' or tremolo; and a shrill, descending whinny. The tremolo is used by pairs or families to keep in touch and is 3-6 seconds long. The whinny is 0.5-2 seconds long and is used to defend territories. These two songs may be given one after the other. Mated pairs may sing to each other antiphonally, both day and night."
Eastern Towhee,Pipilo erythrophthalmus,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,19.05,"The most common call is a two-parted, rising  "" chewink "" ,  "" tow-hee "" , or  "" joree "" , made by both sexes, often as an alarm call. This call can vary in tone geographically from clear whistles to hoarse or nasal sounds. Towhees make several other calls, including a high-pitched, quiet, lisping call for staying in contact, and a sharp  "" tic "" when mobbing or fleeing predators. The classic Eastern Towhee song, given by males, is a loud  "" drink-your-tea! "" lasting about 1 second. The first note ( "" drink "" ) is sharp and metallic, and the final note ( "" tea "" ) is a musical trill. Sometimes the song will start with more than one  "" drink "" ."
Eastern Whip-poor-will,Antrostomus vociferus,Caprimulgidae,Caprimulgiformes,24,"The male's emphatic, chanted  "" whip-poor-will "" , sometimes repeated for hours on end, is a classic sound of warm summer nights in the countryside of the East. It commonly appears in regional songs and literature. A typical call accents the first and last syllable (with a tremulous middle syllable), and immediately starts in on the next call, creating a circular rhythm. Males and females both give a short, sharp  "" quirt "" to contact their mates or express agitation when a predator is near the nest. They also make growls to ward off territorial intruders and hisses to ward off predators. Although Eastern Whip-poor-wills are not technically songbirds, their  "" whip-poor-will "" call functions as a song, since males consistently repeat this call from conspicuous perches during the breeding season."
Eastern Wood-Pewee,Contopus virens,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,15,"Eastern Wood-Pewees have several other calls including a terse  "" chip "" note, a shrill  "" peeee "" given when an intruder disturbs a pair at the nest, and short twittering notes during courtship and mating. Male Eastern Wood-Pewees sing a distinctive, slurred  "" pee-a-wee "" call from exposed perches to advertise their breeding territories. The call lasts about 1 second. The last note trails off; it carries a long way and is a distinctive sound of Eastern forests in summer. Pewees begin singing before sunrise, and you may hear them at almost any time of the day or night."
Elegant Tern,Thalasseus elegans,Laridae,Charadriiformes,40.5,"The most commonly heard call is a sharp, grating  "" karr-eek  "" similar to the call of a Royal Tern but shorter and higher in pitch. Breeding birds give lower-pitched  "" gak "" and  "" kut "" calls, usually when disturbed by other terns or by predators. "
Elegant Trogon,Trogon elegans,Trogonidae,Trogoniformes,NA,Calls are generally a long drawn out note or a short series of quick harsh notes. Song is a hoarse series of downslurred notes sometimes increasing in loudness.  The notes are repeated 5-10 times with a pause before the next set.  The song rate of males is generally much greater than females.
Emperor Goose,Anser canagicus,Anatidae,Anseriformes,68.5,"Emperor Geese have several distinctive calls that sound more nasal and hoarse than those of other arctic-nesting geese: a strident  "" kla-ha  "" given repeatedly in flight and a resonant  "" u-lu  "" when disturbed at the nest. "
Eurasian Collared-Dove,Streptopelia decaocto,Columbidae,Columbiformes,29.5,"When excited or alarmed, they react with a loud  "" hwaah "" , a call they also give just before alighting. Males give the distinctive  "" koo-KOO-kook "" song to defend territories and attract mates. The song may be repeated 3-12 times with the middle syllable much longer than the first and last. Females advertise with a softer version of the song. Both sexes give a lower-pitched, slower version when searching for nest sites and building the nest."
Eurasian Tree Sparrow,Passer montanus,Passeridae,Passeriformes,14.5,"Both sexes give a sweet  "" chip "" call, higher in pitch and more mellifluous than the similar call of House Sparrow, often heard from multiple birds in foraging flocks. In flight, both sexes give a sharper, less musical  "" chweep. "" Males sing a long, rhythmic series of chirps and chips during periods of courtship and nesting."
Eurasian Wigeon,Mareca penelope,Anatidae,Anseriformes,47,"High, scratchy, whistling  "" whe-o. ""  Female quacks. "
European Starling,Sturnus vulgaris,Sturnidae,Passeriformes,21.5,"Male and female starlings use about 10 kinds of calls to communicate about where they are, whether there's danger around, and how aggressive or agitated they feel. Among these are a purr-like call given as the bird takes flight, and a rattle that starlings make as they join a flock on the ground. Two types of screamlike calls indicate aggression and are often accompanied by flapping wings: one is a chattering call (described as  "" chackerchackerchacker "" ); the other is a high-pitched trill. Starlings also make metallic chip notes to other flock members and when harassing or mobbing predators. Starlings are relatives of the mynah birds, and like them they have impressive vocal abilities and a gift for mimicry. They can warble, whistle, chatter, make smooth liquid sounds, harsh trills and rattles, and imitate meadowlarks, jays, and hawks. The songs tend to consist of either loud whistles or softer, jumbled warbling. Whistled songs are a few seconds long, often used between males. Warbled songs can go on for more than a minute, and seem mainly directed at females. Males sing several varieties of each of these two classes of songs. Females also sing, particularly in the fall. Songs often include imitations of other birds, including Eastern Wood-Pewee, Killdeer, meadowlarks, Northern Bobwhite, Brown-headed Cowbird, Northern Flicker, and others."
Evening Grosbeak,Coccothraustes vespertinus,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,17,"Evening Grosbeaks give sweet, piercing calls and burry chirps Although they are songbirds by lineage, Evening Grosbeaks do not have regular songs. They may rarely give short, uneven warbles."
Ferruginous Hawk,Buteo regalis,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,62.5,"When alarmed, adults and fledglings give a scratchy scream reminiscent of a Herring Gull's call. Young nestlings give short cheeps. "
Field Sparrow,Spizella pusilla,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Males and females both give an array of calls, including a single-note 'seep' when foraging together, and a higher-pitched version made by mated pairs when courting and nest building. A brooding female makes a call that sounds like a low-pitched cricket's chirp when her mate approaches the nest with food. Threats will elicit a chip call, possibly to alert a mate or chicks, and the birds will react to hawks with a high, thin, whistled  "" zeeeeee "" . The Field Sparrow's most familiar song is a long, accelerating series of short whistles that build to a rapid trill. It lasts about 4 seconds and has the quality of a bouncing ball coming to rest. In early morning, males sing a more complex song, which begins with the trill followed by longer notes, and is used during territorial interactions."
Fish Crow,Corvus ossifragus,Corvidae,Passeriformes,38,"Fish Crows have a distinctive caw that is short, nasal and quite different-sounding from an American Crow. This call is sometimes doubled-up with an inflection similar to someone saying  "" uh-uh "" . They also make an even shorter, higher-pitched call when in large groups, when perched or in flight. "
Flammulated Owl,Psiloscops flammeolus,Strigidae,Strigiformes,16,"A wide array of calls typical of small owls, including twitters, mews, peeps, hisses, snores, moans, and screams. Males deliver a repeated, low  "" hoot "" , often described as 'ventriloquial' because it can be so difficult for humans to locate the bird from the sound. The song, such as it is, serves to advertise to potential mates and to mark territory."
Florida Scrub-Jay,Aphelocoma coerulescens,Corvidae,Passeriformes,25.5,"Florida Scrub-Jays are vocal birds. The most frequent calls include a scratchy  "" weep "" , repeated in quick succession in flight or while perched; a harsh scold, typically given while perched on top of a shrub; and a guttural growl. When alarmed, females make a rapid, mechanical  "" hiccup ""  sound while bobbing up and down with their bill pointed up. "
Fork-tailed Storm-Petrel,Oceanodroma furcata,Hydrobatidae,Procellariiformes,20,"Near the nest, both sexes give a squeaky, harsh, descending  "" deer-deer-deer-deer "" . Typically silent at sea. "
Forster's Tern,Sterna forsteri,Laridae,Charadriiformes,34.5,"Adults give a harsh  "" kyarrr "" , similar to that of Common Tern but a bit lower in pitch. "
Fox Sparrow,Passerella iliaca,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,17,"When fighting over territory or when a human approaches the nest, Fox Sparrows give  "" smack "" calls (which vary from population to population). Their other calls include  "" chu-chu "" calls and  "" sip "" calls. Male Fox Sparrows sing a sequence of about a dozen rich, whistled notes lasting 2-3 seconds in all, usually from a concealed perch a few feet from the top of a spruce or fir tree. During summer they sing vigorously at any time from before dawn until long after dark, in fair weather or foul. Northern and eastern populations of Fox Sparrows sing one or two song types each, while western populations sing three or four. Western songs tend to be less rich and more burry than eastern songs. The female occasionally sings a softer, briefer version of the male's song."
Franklin's Gull,Leucophaeus pipixcan,Laridae,Charadriiformes,34,"The most commonly heard call from nonbreeding birds is a short, sharp  "" kek "" , given when feeding, flying, or gathering to roost. Birds that have been disturbed give an alarm call that is a rapid series of  "" kek "" calls. Courting males give a 'long call' that is unlike that of other gull species, beginning and ending with a short  "" kah "" and consisting of up to 8 long, high-pitched  "" keeeah "" calls in between. Males also give this call in situations of conflict. "
Fulvous Whistling-Duck,Dendrocygna bicolor,Anatidae,Anseriformes,47.5,"A high-pitched, whistling  "" kee-chee "" , often given in flight. "
Gadwall,Mareca strepera,Anatidae,Anseriformes,51.5,"Male Gadwall make short, deep, reedy calls referred to as 'burps,' given in steady succession or 2-5 at a time while flying. They also make high whistles. Females quack rather like Mallards, but with a slightly higher pitch and more nasal quality. "
Gambel's Quail,Callipepla gambelii,Odontophoridae,Galliformes,25,"Both male and female Gambel's Quail give a distinctive 3-4 note call when separated from covey members. Potential threats or something suspicious near the covey triggers a  "" chip-chip-chip "" , and if a direct threat occurs the birds give a  "" crear-crear "" or  "" squawk "" alarm call as they take wing. During the breeding season males announce their availability with a  "" kaa "" or  "" cow "" call given from an elevated perch. "
Gila Woodpecker,Melanerpes uropygialis,Picidae,Piciformes,23,"Gila Woodpeckers give a rolling series of notes on one pitch, similar to the commonest call of Red-bellied Woodpecker or Northern Flicker. Both sexes give this call, but males tend to call more frequently. Both sexes also give a higher-pitched series of  "" piip  "" notes, with females tending to give this call more frequently. "
Gilded Flicker,Colaptes chrysoides,Picidae,Piciformes,28,"Call a long series of loud  "" wik-wik-wik ""  notes. Also a softer  "" wik-a-wik-a-wik-a, ""  and a strong single-note  "" peah. ""  "
Glaucous Gull,Larus hyperboreus,Laridae,Charadriiformes,68,"Calls are yelping, mewing, and clucking sounds very similar to those of the more widespread Herring Gull but often higher in pitch. "
Glaucous-winged Gull,Larus glaucescens,Laridae,Charadriiformes,54.5,"A low, piercing  "" kiau "" is the most commonly heard call, similar to other large gulls' calls; also a low  "" cow-cow-cow.  "" The 'long call' is a series of higher-pitched, longer notes, shortening and descending as they progress, that resemble similar calls of Western and Herring Gulls—this is the gull vocalization that many people associate generally with the 'seashore.' On breeding grounds, males and females give a great variety of calls in courtship and threat displays. "
Glossy Ibis,Plegadis falcinellus,Threskiornithidae,Pelecaniformes,57,"Glossy Ibises call infrequently, though flocks sometimes call quietly as they forage, a throaty murmuring sound. Disturbed birds often give a guttural grunt when flying off. Begging chicks flap and make insectlike buzzing sounds when parents return to the nest; adults give raspy grunts when arriving. Courting birds give much softer, dovelike coos. No song."
Golden Eagle,Aquila chrysaetos,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,77,"Golden Eagles are not big talkers. Their occasional calls tend to be high, weak, and whistled. You're most likely to hear these birds during breeding season, when nestlings' high-pitched begging calls can travel a mile or more, and adults announce food deliveries with a  "" wip "" or a  "" wonk "" . "
Golden-cheeked Warbler,Setophaga chrysoparia,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12.5," Song buzzy and slow  "" ter-wih-zeee-e-e-e, chy ""  or  "" bzzzz, layzee, dayzee. "" "
Golden-crowned Kinglet,Regulus satrapa,Regulidae,Passeriformes,9.5,"Both males and females give thin, threadlike  "" tsee "" notes, often two or three in a row, to contact each other. Golden-crowned Kinglets sing an ascending, accelerating series of up to 14 very high-pitched  "" tsee "" notes lasting up to 3 seconds and sometimes ending in a musical warble that drops an octave or more in pitch. This is one of the first bird songs that people stop being able to hear as they age. Both males and females sing while constructing the nest, when other songbirds approach, and when predators are nearby, and males sing to proclaim their territory."
Golden-crowned Sparrow,Zonotrichia atricapilla,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,16.5,"Calls include a loud  "" chink "" alarm call, three kinds of feeding calls ( "" chip "" ,  "" churr "" , and  "" plear plear plear "" ) and a flat  "" tchup "" . Golden-crowned Sparrows have a song of several clear whistles, sliding downward in a melancholy phrase that's sometimes described as 'I'm so tired' or 'oh, dear me.' Often, they add a trill to the end. Males sing from the treetops, rooftops, and the tops and edges of shrub thickets, mainly in the early breeding season but also at other times of year."
Golden-fronted Woodpecker,Melanerpes aurifrons,Picidae,Piciformes,24,"Call a loud, raspy  "" churr. ""  Also short  "" check ""  notes and drums. "
Golden-winged Warbler,Vermivora chrysoptera,Parulidae,Passeriformes,13,"Males and females give  "" tzip "" notes to each other during courtship. Adults make a  "" zeee "" note to young as they leave the nest and during the postfledging period. Males sing a buzzy, two-parted song: a long note on a high pitch followed by 3-6 shorter, lower notes. Another song, often given repeatedly before dawn, is a rapid stutter followed by lower buzzy notes. It is associated with territorial defense."
Grace's Warbler,Setophaga graciae,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12,"The most common call note is a fairly loud, rich, smacking  "" tsip "" . Male sings an accelerating series of sweet notes, rising at the end."
Grasshopper Sparrow,Ammodramus savannarum,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,11.15,"The main call note is a high-pitched  "" seet. "" They also make a series of staccato two-parted  "" tiddick  "" notes when alarmed.  The Grasshopper Sparrow's typical song is a thin, insectlike buzz preceded by two to three ticking chips,  "" tick tick pzzzzzzzz.  "" Males also perform a squeaky, chirping song associated with flight display, though this is less frequently observed. "
Gray Catbird,Dumetella carolinensis,Mimidae,Passeriformes,22.5,"The most common call is a raspy mew that sounds like a cat. Catbirds also make a loud, chattering  "" chek-chek-chek "" and a quiet  "" quirt "" . Male Gray Catbirds sing a long, halting series of short notes collected into  "" phrases, ""  which combine to make a song. One whole song can last many minutes. Sounds include whistles, squeaks, gurgles, whines, and nasal tones. The notes often are imitations of other birds as well as of frogs and mechanical sounds. The series of sounds is random, but certain notes are often repeated. While mockingbirds tend to repeat phrases three or more times, and Brown Thrashers typically sing phrases twice before moving on, Catbirds usually don't repeat phrases. Females sing infrequently, and when they do, their songs are sung more quietly."
Gray Flycatcher,Empidonax wrightii,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,14.5,"Both sexes give a loud  "" whit "" call note. Males sing a sharp, quick  "" chibit  "" often followed by a higher-pitched, rising  "" tweet.  "" The use of these elements varies, with some (especially the  "" chibit "" ) repeated in quick sequences. Males also perform a flight song, a rapid series of  "" whit  "" calls notes followed by a jumble of other call types."
Gray Hawk,Buteo plagiatus,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,NA,"Gray Hawks make two vocalizations. The first is a 3-note whistled call that is given throughout the breeding season.  It is used to define territories, maintain pairs, and advertise locations to potential mates.  The call can be rolled, slurred, and exaggerated at times. Gray Hawks also give a single-note alarm call, which females give mainly when irritated or alarmed.  It can also indicate excitement during prey exchange or copulation, disputes between males, or food begging by nestlings. This call is used year-round. "
Gray Partridge,Perdix perdix,Phasianidae,Galliformes,31.5,"Gray Partridges have a short, scratchy ternlike call that lasts for less than 1 second. When they flush they give a rapid, scratchy  "" kut, kut, kut "" .  "
Gray Vireo,Vireo vicinior,Vireonidae,Passeriformes,14,"In alarm or when defending the nest area, both sexes give short, nasal calls and rapid-fire series of raspy notes, similar to other vireos' alarm calls. Males sing a long, leisurely series of paired  "" che-wee "" , "" chee-woo  "" or similar whistles that rise or fall in pitch. The quality is less burry than in many other vireos' songs. Females sometimes sing partial songs that are similar. Males also have a much more hurried and varied version of the song."
Gray-cheeked Thrush,Catharus minimus,Turdidae,Passeriformes,16.5,"Complex song of burry flute-like notes, usually ending on a downslur. Nocturnal flight note a one-or two-note  "" whe-eer ""  dropping in pitch. "
Gray-crowned Rosy-Finch,Leucosticte tephrocotis,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,17.5,"An incisive, rising, buzzy  "" chew  "" is the most commonly heard call, given in flight and many different interactions. Alarm calls include chirping and squawking sounds. Males court females with a twittering, buzzy carol, a series of  "" chew "" notes that vary in pitch and loudness and are interspersed with other calls. In the Aleutian Islands, females occasionally sing as well."
Great Black-backed Gull,Larus marinus,Laridae,Charadriiformes,75,"Both male and female Great Black-backed Gulls have deep, hoarse, swallowed-sounding calls. They also give long, trumpeting calls made up of similar deep sounds combined with louder, higher-pitched notes. They make these calls while raising and lowering their heads repeatedly. "
Great Blue Heron,Ardea herodias,Ardeidae,Pelecaniformes,117,"Great Blue Herons are most vocal on the breeding grounds, where they greet their partner with squawking  "" roh-roh-rohs "" in a 'landing call' when arriving at the nest. A disturbance can trigger a series of clucking  "" go-go-gos "" , building to a rapid  "" frawnk "" squawk that can last up to 20 seconds. If directly threatened, birds react with a screaming  "" awk "" lasting just over 2 seconds. Chicks give a  "" tik-tik-tik "" call within minutes of hatching. "
Great Cormorant,Phalacrocorax carbo,Phalacrocoracidae,Suliformes,87,"Resonant, guttural and purring calls at the nest but otherwise silent. "
Great Crested Flycatcher,Myiarchus crinitus,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,19,"Males and females share four basic daytime calls. The most characteristic and frequent call is a loud, penetrating  "" whee-eep "" whistle that rises quickly and ends abruptly. This call may serve as a contact call between a mated pair or between parents and young. But it is also given as a warning if either parent spots an intruder or predator nearing the nest. The simplest call is a shorter version of the whistle that's usually repeated rapidly 3-10 times. It indicates stress and excitement. A relaxed, slightly burry, vibrato all is given by foraging birds, when flying, or by mates to each other. It's the most common call between mates and may be a locator note. It's also tossed between distant neighbors, but is replaced by other calls if an encounter heats up. These three notes can be modified in pitch and duration, and also be strung together in multi-call bursts or  "" runs, ""  along with a variety of less stylized calls.The fourth common call, a rasping or stuttering  "" rurr "" , is the harshest sounding and indicates stress and alarm. The male sings a three-part dawn song: two short, sweeping whistles (one low- and one high-pitched) and a low burry vibrato. The order of these sylllables can vary, and the whole song lasts about 3 seconds. The two upsweeping whistles resemble the  "" whee-eep "" call (see Calls), but are more relaxed. The final note is sometimes absent or may be so soft it can only be heard by a nearby mate. Singing can become intense just before dawn: a male within the canopy may sing every two seconds in bouts of 15 to 30 minutes."
Great Egret,Ardea alba,Ardeidae,Pelecaniformes,99,"Great Egrets make dry, croaking sounds, nasal squeals, and other harsh calls. They are particularly vocal during breeding season as they go about establishing territories, courting, forming pairs, and maintaining pair bonds. "
Great Gray Owl,Strix nebulosa,Strigidae,Strigiformes,72.5,"Adults also make a soft double hoot when defending territories or during food delivery. During the breeding season (roughly from March-July), males and females give a low-pitched series of resonating  "" hoos "" that last for 6-8 seconds with about 30 seconds between calls. The male's vocalization is lower pitched than the female's."
Great Horned Owl,Bubo virginianus,Strigidae,Strigiformes,54.5,"Young owls give piercing screams when begging for food, while adults may scream to defend the nest. Adults make an array of other sounds, including whistles, barks, shrieks, hisses, coos, and wavering cries. Great Horned Owls advertise their territories with deep, soft hoots with a stuttering rhythm:  "" hoo-h'HOO-hoo-hoo "" . The male and female of a breeding pair may perform a duet of alternating calls, with the female's voice recognizably higher in pitch than the male's."
Great Kiskadee,Pitangus sulphuratus,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,NA,"Their namesake call is a three-syllable delivery, with a sharp accent on the first syllable (which someone thought sounded like  "" KIS-ka-dee "" , though many choose other descriptions). It is given in many different situations, such as among mates, across neighboring territories, or during disputes. They also give a short one-syllable, protesting screechy call when harassing predators or to scatter other birds at a feeding site. "
Great-tailed Grackle,Quiscalus mexicanus,Icteridae,Passeriformes,42,"When ready to mate, both sexes give a 'solicitation call' of clear  "" cheat "" or  "" che "" notes. Both males and females also make a low-pitched, hard  "" chut "" alarm call, and males give a loud  "" clack "" in response to humans and other predators. Females 'chatter' when building the nest and when incubating eggs and feeding young. Great-tailed Grackles make an impressive array of sounds, ranging from sweet, tinkling notes to what one biologist described as 'calls so loud they were best heard at a distance.' Other descriptions include 'rusty gate hinge' and 'machinery badly in need of lubrication.' The male's territorial song includes a sound like crackling brush, a rapid-fire  "" ki ki ki "" repeated 1-12 times, mechanical rattling notes, and a shrieking, high-pitched whistle."
Greater Pewee,Contopus pertinax,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,18,"Call a  "" pip-pip-pip. ""  Song a clear whistled  "" Ho-say ma-ree-ah. "" "
Greater Prairie-Chicken,Tympanuchus cupido,Phasianidae,Galliformes,43,"The low booming of displaying males is made by air passing through the syrinx and amplified by the inflating air sacs, which are extensions of the esophagus. Displaying males also give cluck, whoop, whine, and cackle. Females make a  "" kuk "" call in interactions with other adults, a  "" brirrrb "" call when gathering their chicks, and a  "" kwerr  "" call when warning them about predators. "
Greater Roadrunner,Geococcyx californianus,Cuculidae,Cuculiformes,53,"Both members of a pair give a single-note coo as part of a display following copulation. Another variation sounds like a low-pitched growl and is given when a pair forages together, or by a parent communicating with chicks on the nest. Both male and female also make a short, sharp barking call that sounds like a yipping coyote. Females bark when at the nest site in response to a mate foraging nearby. As part of the courtship display, males make a low-pitched call consisting of mechanical-sounding  "" putts "" and whirs as he faces the female. Male Greater Roadrunners make a distinct  "" co-coo-coo-coo-coooooo "" in a series of 3-8 downward slurring notes to attract or contact a mate and mark a territory. Beginning before sunrise, the cooing can be heard up to a quarter-mile away, and often elicits a response from a neighboring male."
Greater Sage-Grouse,Centrocercus urophasianus,Phasianidae,Galliformes,65.5,"Off the lek, males make a soft  "" wut "" call when warning others of predators. Females give a variety of calls, though their function has not been well studied. When accompanying a brood, a soft, repetitive warning call indicates danger, while a single-note contact call helps keep chicks together. To distract or confront a predator, they use a loud hissing call. Females also call when soliciting males on the lek. "
Greater Scaup,Aythya marila,Anatidae,Anseriformes,47.5,"Males and females tend to be more vocal during the breeding season; otherwise they are fairly quiet. The male gives a soft, nasal whistle during courtship. The female gives a hoarse, raspy  "" arr-arr-arr "" often while stretching her neck or when alarmed.  "
Greater White-fronted Goose,Anser albifrons,Anatidae,Anseriformes,72.5,"In flight Greater White-fronted Geese sound like they are laughing—a high-pitched yelping call, consisting of two or three notes. They also give a high-pitched squeak that trails off at the end.  "
Greater Yellowlegs,Tringa melanoleuca,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,31,"The typical call of the Greater Yellowlegs is a clear, ringing  "" tew tew tew "" , given in sequences of three or more (sometimes described as if the bird is saying its name:  "" yel-low-legs "" ). During the male's elaborate courting display, he gives an insistent  "" tuu-whee tuu-whee "" yodel that is rarely heard away from the breeding grounds.  Song a repeated, rolling  "" kee-lee-wee "" ."
Green Heron,Butorides virescens,Ardeidae,Pelecaniformes,43.5,"Green Herons give a harsh, explosive  "" skeow "" call that, once learned, is a distinctive sound of wetlands. They give it while perched, when flying, or when disturbed by an approaching predator. When disturbed at the nest they use a series of raspy clucks,  "" kuk-kuk-kuk-kuk "" . They also give grating screams. "
Green Jay,Cyanocorax yncas,Corvidae,Passeriformes,29,"Green Jays give frequent, loud bell-like calls in flight and fairly regular, loud  "" cheh "" contact calls when foraging together. Many other calls, used in specific social contexts, sound like screaming, bubbling, rattling, buzzing, peeping, and clicking. "
Green-tailed Towhee,Pipilo chlorurus,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,NA,"Green-tailed Towhees have a distinctive mewing call that is thin, high, and rises in pitch. Both sexes use this call to stay in contact while foraging, upon leaving the nest, or while in flight. When alarmed, they make a sharp, repeated  "" tick "" note. Males sing a long, jumbled series of clear whistles and trills lasting about 2.5 seconds. A singing male at the height of the breeding season may sing up to 12 songs per minute."
Green-winged Teal,Anas crecca,Anatidae,Anseriformes,35,"Males give a clear whistling call as part of several courtship displays, sometimes adding a rapid chitter. Green-winged Teal females give a repeated, shrill quack on the wintering grounds, during courtship, and to distract potential predators when brooding. They also give 5-15 fast, persistent quacks, about 2 per second, when searching for nest sites, perhaps to lure potential predators out and assess a site's safety. A series of 4-7 quacks of decreasing volume is given during courtship, as well as a harsh, rattling call made when inciting a male during pair formation. "
Groove-billed Ani,Crotophaga sulcirostris,Cuculidae,Cuculiformes,34,"A rather loud, incisive, high-pitched  "" tsweeuw  "" is given in flight and in many different interactions. "
Gull-billed Tern,Gelochelidon nilotica,Laridae,Charadriiformes,35.5,"Call a slightly upslurred  "" kay-wek. ""  "
Gunnison Sage-Grouse,Centrocercus minimus,Phasianidae,Galliformes,51,"Off the lek, males make a soft  "" wut "" call when warning others of predators. Females give a variety of calls, though their function has not been well studied. When accompanying a brood, females have both a contact call, and a call to warn their young of danger. To distract or confront a predator, they use a loud hissing call. Females also call when soliciting males on the lek. "
Gyrfalcon,Falco rusticolus,Falconidae,Falconiformes,56,"When alarmed, Gyrfalcons give a hoarse 'kak kak kak' with several repetitions per second. They give a sharp 'chup' when foraging or transferring food, repeating it up to 20 times. Other calls include chatters, wails, and low whines. The female's calls are usually lower in pitch than the male's. "
Hairy Woodpecker,Dryobates villosus,Picidae,Piciformes,22,"The most common call of the Hairy Woodpecker is a short, sharp  "" peek "" note very similar to Downy Woodpeckers, but slightly lower pitched and often sounding more emphatic. Hairy Woodpeckers also make a rattle or whinny. This call is also similar to the Downy Woodpecker but does not descend in pitch at the end. "
Hammond's Flycatcher,Empidonax hammondii,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,14,"A clipped but sweet  "" pip  "" is the most commonly heard call, probably used as an alarm and contact call. Other buzzy, trilled, and whistled calls are limited to the breeding grounds. The short 3-part song begins with a quick  "" se-put "" , following by a husky  "" tsurrt "" , and ending with a low-pitched  "" chu-lup.  "" The whole song lasts about 1.5 seconds. The last element of the song is clearly lower in pitch than the last element of Dusky Flycatcher's song."
Harlequin Duck,Histrionicus histrionicus,Anatidae,Anseriformes,40,"Quite vocal for a sea duck. The common vocalization is a mouselike squeak, which can vary in frequency and intensity. "
Harris's Hawk,Parabuteo unicinctus,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,52.5,"Harris's Hawks have an angry sounding, grating call given on territories or at a kill site when intruders are near. The call lasts for about 3 seconds.  "
Harris's Sparrow,Zonotrichia querula,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,18.5,"Male and female sparrows most often call with a loud  "" tchip "" when foraging in flocks and connecting with each other. When they are alarmed they utter a louder  "" weenk "" . The song of the Harris's Sparrow is a simple plaintive whistle made up of 1-3 evenly spaced notes. This is one song that is easy to imitate because each note is on the same pitch. Its song lasts for about 2 seconds, but it will continue to sing about 10 songs per minute, often singing for nearly an hour. Sometimes it will mix in a few buzzy, hoarse notes into its song. The male sings from exposed perches within its territory, singing more frequently in the morning and in the evening than during midday."
Heermann's Gull,Larus heermanni,Laridae,Charadriiformes,49.5,"Males give a rapid series of  "" ah "" calls, sounding like laughter, during courtship. Both sexes give a low-pitched,  "" ow "" or  "" ow-ak "" in many contexts and a high-pitched, reedy call when squabbling over food at sea. "
Henslow's Sparrow,Centronyx henslowii,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,12,"The usual alarm call of the Henslow's Sparrow is a sharp  "" tsip.  "" They also make a series of high-pitched whistles during the height of the breeding season. The Henslow's Sparrow has the simplest and shortest song of any North American songbird. To the human ear it is a simple, buzzed  "" tzelick "" , but spectrographic analysis reveals a more complicated song that is outside the range of human hearing."
Hepatic Tanager,Piranga flava,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,14.4,"A clipped  "" tchup  "" is the most commonly heard call; in flight, birds occasionally give a soft, jaylike  "" wenk "" . Primary song is a sweet, mellow, robinlike warble that might recall Black-headed Grosbeak, lasting 3-4 seconds "" . "" "
Hermit Thrush,Catharus guttatus,Turdidae,Passeriformes,16,"The Hermit Thrush's most frequently heard call is a low-pitched  "" tchup "" or  "" quoit "" to signal attack or escape and a Cedar Waxwing-like  "" eeee "" when in danger. Adults may tell their young to stay still with a two-syllable  "" chuck "" and  "" lisp "" . The Hermit Thrush's beautiful, haunting song begins with a sustained whistle and ends with softer, echo-like tones, described as  "" oh, holy holy, ah, purity purity eeh, sweetly sweetly "" . It pauses between each phrase, and the song is about 1.5 seconds long. Hermit Thrushes also deliver an extremely faint 'whisper song' in spring."
Hermit Warbler,Setophaga occidentalis,Parulidae,Passeriformes,14,"Calls include a flat, dry  "" chip  "" and a high-pitched  "" zee "" (in flight). Like its close relatives in the  "" golden-cheeked ""  complex of warblers, Hermit has two different songs. Most often heard is a series of 4 high-pitched notes, followed by a descending phrase, and ending in rapid series of buzzy notes, sometimes with a final high-pitched note. The alternate song begins with 3 or 4 buzzy notes and ends with a rising-and-falling ending phrase."
Herring Gull,Larus argentatus,Laridae,Charadriiformes,61,"Herring Gulls have a rich repertoire of calls, each of which may be modified in different contexts and accompanied by different postures. For example, the long-drawn single note of their  "" mew "" call is always accompanied by an arched neck, but serves to attract attention in contexts as diverse as courtship, chick feeding, nest approaches, or agitated aggression. Their characteristic  "" ha-ha-ha-ha "" alarm call may change to a plaintive  "" yeow "" in flight or a yelping  "" keow "" as the threat intensifies. That  "" keow "" is highly individual and can serve as personal identification. When trumpeted more and more shrilly as the gull lowers and then raises its head, this becomes the gull's  "" long call, ""  the most elaborate, variable, and individualized call in its repertoire. Both sexes make a repeated  "" huoh-huoh-huoh "" in courtship, territorial disputes, and nest selection to indicate some version of  "" I'm not moving. ""  It's been called their 'choking call' because the birds deliver the call while leaning forward, head down, and heaving upward as they call. Chicks beg for regurgitated food with a  "" klee-ew "" call that they first peep while inside the egg. And adults use the same call in a softer  "" baby-talk ""  version during courtship or in exchanges when the male returns to take his turn on the nest. "
Hoary Redpoll,Acanthis hornemanni,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,13,"At least nine different calls have been described, most sounding like a very buzzy chatter, a rattle, and a rising, sweeter note. All of these calls are similar to calls of Common Redpoll and Pine Siskin. Male Hoary Redpoll songs consists of their different call notes, sung in sets of phrases that usually have pauses between them. After pairing with a female, males sing a similar song that is shorter, quieter, and often lacks pauses."
Hooded Merganser,Lophodytes cucullatus,Anatidae,Anseriformes,44.5,"Hooded Mergansers are usually silent, but they call during courtship and around nest sites. A courting male makes a deep, rolling sound like the call of a pickerel frog, earning it the nickname of 'frog-duck' in Georgia. Females give a hoarse  "" gack "" call during courtship. When females call in flight or to newly hatched ducklings, they use a rough  "" croo-croo-crook "" similar to that of many sea ducks. "
Hooded Oriole,Icterus cucullatus,Icteridae,Passeriformes,19,"Their call is a sharp and nasal sounding  "" wheet "" that sounds a bit like a House Finch call. They also give a harsh  "" chuck "" .  Like most orioles, they string together their calls with nearly nonstop chatter. Their chatter is soft, dry, and throaty sounding, perhaps a bit weaker sounding than Baltimore Oriole chatter. As with other orioles, both male and female Hooded Orioles sing. The female's song tends to be less complicated than the male's. They sing a scratchy, abrupt warble interspersed with catlike cries, chatters, and sometimes mimicked parts of the songs of other species. Songs last about 1 to 4 seconds. Their song is highly variable and lacks the sweet melodies of other orioles."
Hooded Warbler,Setophaga citrina,Parulidae,Passeriformes,13,"Males and females give a loud and metallic-sounding  "" chip "" during territory defense on the breeding and wintering grounds, though females call more often than males on the breeding grounds.  Hooded Warblers sing an emphatic and loud ringing song. Only males are thought to sing, but female song was documented once in Pennsylvania. The primary song consists of 4-5 notes—a clear  "" weeta-weeta-weet-tee-o "" , which some interpret as  "" Richie Rich, I'm right here. ""  Males also sing a secondary song that is a bit more jumbled at the beginning."
Horned Grebe,Podiceps auritus,Podicipedidae,Podicipediformes,34.5,"Calls a loud, nasal  "" aaarrrh ""  descending in pitch, and a pulsing trill. Usually silent in winter. "
Horned Lark,Eremophila alpestris,Alaudidae,Passeriformes,18,"The Horned Lark's typical call, most often heard in fall and winter, is a high, piercing one- or two-note chip. Horned Larks sing a delicate, musical song particularly in the early morning as early as an hour and a half before sunrise. It's a fast, high-pitched sequence of sharp, tinkling notes, often rising in pitch to a quick jumble of concluding notes. Songs are typically a couple of seconds long but may go on for more than a minute. Males usually sing from a post, rock, clod, mound or other perch, but may sing on the wing, from a height of up to about 800 feet in the air."
Horned Puffin,Fratercula corniculata,Alcidae,Charadriiformes,NA,"Low, rather guttural calls sounding like croaking, growling, purring, and popping. "
House Finch,Haemorhous mexicanus,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Male and female House Finch calls are a sharp  "" cheep "" made often, including while perched and during flight. You may hear a sharper version of this call as the birds flush from the ground. Male House Finches sing a long, jumbled warbling composed of short notes. The song often ends with an upward or downward slur, and lasts about 3 seconds. Males may sing throughout the year. Females sometimes give a shorter, simpler version of the song. Compared with Cassin's and Purple finches, House Finch songs sound slower, rougher, and somewhat less fluid. The final slurred note is more often heard in House Finches than in the other two species."
House Sparrow,Passer domesticus,Passeridae,Passeriformes,16,"Male and female House Sparrows make single  "" cheep "" notes to indicate submissiveness in flocks, or between pairs as part of courting or copulation. Females make a short chattering sound when chasing off other females, or when her mate approaches. House Sparrows have a rather simple song of one or a series of  "" cheep "" or  "" chirrup "" notes. It's mainly given by males, who repeat it incessantly during much of the year to announce that they possess a nest and to attract females. Females only rarely use this song, typically to attract a new mate after losing one."
House Wren,Troglodytes aedon,Troglodytidae,Passeriformes,12,"House Wrens make a variety of harsh sounds: churrs, chatters, rattles, and scolds, often in response to large animals that might be predators. For this reason, they can often be coaxed into view with squeaks or pishing sounds. Both males and females sing. Males often sing 9-11 times per minute during breeding season. Songs are a long, jumbled bubbling introduced by abrupt churrs and scolds and made up of 12-16 recognizable syllables. Females sing mainly in answer to their mates shortly after pairing up; their songs can include high-pitched squeals unlike any sounds males make."
Hudsonian Godwit,Limosa haemastica,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,39,"A sweet, downward  "" deew-doo  "" and a drier  "" whit "" are the most commonly heard calls. In flight, males give rollicking, rhythmic, rapidly repeated sets of phrases, similar in quality to other godwits' flight display vocalizations, that may be considered 'song.'"
Hutton's Vireo,Vireo huttoni,Vireonidae,Passeriformes,11,"The most often heard calls are a nasal  "" chu "" and a flat  "" chit "" . Song is a rising  "" zu-wee "" or a descending  "" zo-zoo,  "" repeated over and over again at about one per second for as long as 10 minutes."
Iceland Gull,Larus glaucoides,Laridae,Charadriiformes,55,"Like many other gulls, Iceland Gulls have several calls. One known as the 'main call' is a repeated series of two-parted 'kee-ya' notes. It's often used as an alarm call, and at nest colonies can spur the entire colony to plunge off their high cliff nests into the air. The 'long call' is similar to (but shriller than) the classic, repeated series of calls that Herring Gulls give from dock pilings. They also give various shorter barking or mewing calls when taking flight or settling into the nest. "
Inca Dove,Columbina inca,Columbidae,Columbiformes,20.5,"It makes an aggressive stuttering coo of 4-5 distinct notes for about 2 seconds. The male and sometimes the female Inca Dove call a low mournful coo that sounds like they are saying 'no hope.' Each call lasts less than 1 second, but the bird repeats the same notes over and over."
Indigo Bunting,Passerina cyanea,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"Indigo Buntings give short, sharp, thin, one-syllable  "" spit ""  or  "" chip ""  calls. Male Indigo Buntings whistle a bright, lively song of sharp, clear, high-pitched notes that lasts about 2 seconds. They are voluble, singing as many as 200 songs per hour at dawn and keeping up a pace of about one per minute for the rest of the day. Notes or phrases are often repeated in pairs:  "" <i>what! what! where? where? see it! see it!</i> ""   This pattern is recognizable, although the precise tune varies from place to place. Young Indigo Buntings learn their songs from males near where they settle to breed, and this leads to 'song neighborhoods' in which all nearby males sing songs that are similar to each other and that are different from those sung more than a few hundred yards away."
Ivory Gull,Pagophila eburnea,Laridae,Charadriiformes,41.5,"A very harsh, grating, high-pitched  "" keeuur  "" is the most commonly heard call. On the breeding grounds and at the nest, also gives a longer version as a 'long call,' a much longer version as a distress call, and a variety of softer calls during courtship. "
Ivory-billed Woodpecker,Campephilus principalis,Picidae,Piciformes,48.5,"Call is a nasal tooting  "" kent "" often described as the sound of a 'tin trumpet' or of blowing on a clarinet mouthpiece. The call could be given singly or as two notes together, and was often given while feeding. The sound was not nearly as loud as a Pileated Woodpecker's call, and was estimated to be audible from a quarter-mile away at best. "
Juniper Titmouse,Baeolophus ridgwayi,Paridae,Passeriformes,NA,"The most frequently heard call is harsh and scratchy, often given in response to intruders. It is also used to maintain contact with their mate while foraging. They also give a short, rapid 3-syllable call that sounds similar to their song. The Juniper Titmouse sings a rapid and rolling series of 5 to 15 syllables that sounds almost like a video game. Their rapid-fire song lasts about 3 seconds. Juniper Titmice sing all year, but sing more frequently in the spring and summer months."
Kentucky Warbler,Geothlypis formosa,Parulidae,Passeriformes,13,"Call a smacking  "" chip. ""  Song a loud series of  "" chuuree ""  notes. "
Killdeer,Charadrius vociferus,Charadriidae,Charadriiformes,24,"Most noticeable among the Killdeer's many calls is the high, plaintive  "" kill-deer "" the bird is named for. Displaying males give this 0.5-second call over and over while in flight. Birds in distress or sounding an alarm make a sharp  "" dee "" that can intensify into a nervous, bubbling trill. This trill may also be used in courtship displays. "
King Eider,Somateria spectabilis,Anatidae,Anseriformes,55.5,"Males give a gentle, dovelike  "" ruuurrr  "" call, often repeated, when courting females. Both sexes give a low  "" kwak "" in alarm, along with growling, croaking, grunting, and murmuring calls heard mostly on breeding grounds. Birds observed in winter well south of the typical range are mostly silent. "
King Rail,Rallus elegans,Rallidae,Gruiformes,43,"The call most often heard is a descending series of grunt-like sounds, very similar to calls of Clapper and Virginia Rails, which serves as an alarm call, a contact call, and a territorial defense duet. Another call shared by all three is a  "" kik-brrrr "" , whose function is unclear. Six or seven other calls, rarely heard, are involved in courtship, nesting, defense, and brood rearing. A series of abrupt  "" kek "" notes, often a long series, usually slowing in cadence toward the end and often given at night. Very similar to song of Clapper Rail but chestier, deeper, slower, and more staccato. They sing most frequently during establishment of territory through nesting but may sing at any time of year in the southern parts of range."
Kirtland's Warbler,Setophaga kirtlandii,Parulidae,Passeriformes,14.5," Song clear and emphatic  "" chip-chip-che-way-o. "" "
Ladder-backed Woodpecker,Dryobates scalaris,Picidae,Piciformes,17,"The most common call is a loud  "" peek "" ; it is sometimes louder, longer, and higher in pitch than the comparable  "" pit  "" call of Nuttall's. Pairs use the  "" peek "" call to stay in contact when they cannot see each other, but males also use it during conflicts. Also, as in other small woodpeckers, there is a rattling call, which sometimes follows the  "" peek "" call. Other calls, often associated with conflict, include  "" kweek "" ,  "" wicka "" , "" twek "" , and  "" kwah "" , but these are seldom heard.         "
Lapland Longspur,Calcarius lapponicus,Calcariidae,Passeriformes,15.5,"The Lapland Longspur makes a wide variety of call notes for a great many situations. The most commonly heard calls are contact calls heard between individuals in a flock, a series of melodic chirps described as  "" kittyoo  "" or  "" trrr.  "" Their common flight call is a dry  "" prrrt. "" A long, rapid series of squeaky, jingling notes with significant variation. Lapland Longspur songs are notably loud, and can be heard for up to 1km on calm days."
Lark Bunting,Calamospiza melanocorys,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,16,"The most common call note, often given by birds in flight, is a distinctive, gentle  "" hweee "" , given by both sexes. Parents returning to the nest give a chittering call and while feeding young give a  "" whert  "" call. Begging young sometimes give an insectlike buzzy call. In spring and summer, males sing two different songs, both composed of repeated notes—given either slowly and distinctly or more rapidly, as trills. Songs are delivered in distinct phrases and can last up to 8 seconds. Males arrive on the breeding territory, ahead of the females; they tend to sing an 'aggressive flight song,' marked by harsher notes and by pauses between phrases. As males establish territories and pairs form, males switch to singing a sweeter, faster song, from a perch or in flight.  "
Lark Sparrow,Chondestes grammacus,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,16,"Both male and female Lark Sparrows give a sharp metallic  "" tink "" . Male Lark Sparrows sing a melodious jumble of clear notes and trills interspersed with harsh buzzes and churrs. The song generally starts with a short buzz followed by 1-3 clear notes, then a few notes at a lower pitch, and finally a clear trill; they often switch up the order of the notes. Listen for the short buzzes within the jumble to help identify the song. Look for them singing from elevated perches including fence posts, shrubs, and telephone wires."
Laughing Gull,Leucophaeus atricilla,Laridae,Charadriiformes,42.5,"This is a very vocal species whose common call is a loud, descending series of laughing notes lasting 3 seconds or more. They also make a short stuttered alarm call when people, predators, or other gulls approach too closely. This can accelerate and intensify into a loud call lasting several minutes if the birds are defending a nest. "
Lawrence's Goldfinch,Spinus lawrencei,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,11,"A distinctive  "" tink-oo "" is given in or just before flight.  Less commonly heard are harsh alarm calls and soft, tinkling contact calls, given mostly during the nesting season. Males sing a long, jumbled, varied series of high-pitched notes, tinkles, and trills, a bit higher in pitch and more musical than songs of other goldfinches, and often peppered with imitations of other bird species, including flycatchers, wrens, thrushes, and even falcons."
Laysan Albatross,Phoebastria immutabilis,Diomedeidae,Procellariiformes,80,"Laysan Albatrosses make a variety of whining, squeaking, grunting, and moaning calls on the breeding grounds, particularly during courtship. "
Lazuli Bunting,Passerina amoena,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,14,"The most frequently heard call is a sharp, metallic  "" pik "" given by both males and females. Males sing a complex series of jumbling and squeaky notes that they repeat 2-5 times for about 3 seconds. Although the basic elements of the song remain the same, males switch up the order of the notes, giving variety to their songs. During territory establishment, males sing about 4 songs per minute, but they sing more often during territorial disputes and when the female begins incubating."
LeConte's Sparrow,Ammospiza leconteii,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"The common call note is a sharp and shrill  "" tsip "" . Male LeConte's Sparrows sing a simple song consisting of 2-3 thin chips followed by a short trill."
LeConte's Thrasher,Toxostoma lecontei,Mimidae,Passeriformes,26,"The most commonly heard call is a short, rising whistled  "" suuuweeeep "" . Distressed birds also give a double-note whistle similar to that of Curve-billed Thrasher but less incisive. Male sings an incredibly varied series of calls, higher in pitch and squeakier-sounding than other thrashers' songs and usually lacking doubled or tripled phrasing. Females also sing on occasion; their songs are similar to male songs."
Least Bittern,Ixobrychus exilis,Ardeidae,Pelecaniformes,32,"Least Bitterns make a variety of calls, including a ticking sound made by a receptive female in response to a singing male, a rail-like  "" gak-gak!  "" that apparently serves as a contact call between mates, and other cackles, clucks, hisses, and shrieks—probably used as alarm calls or in threat displays against predators. Flying nocturnal migrants sometimes give a high, clucking  "" gark  "" that recalls Green Heron or American Bittern but is higher in pitch. In spring, males sing a subtle, quiet  "" coo-coo-coo-coo "" from concealed locations to attract mates and mark territory. "
Least Flycatcher,Empidonax minimus,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,13,"Males and females  "" whit "" softly while feeding and attending to the nest. When they feel threatened the  "" whit "" becomes louder and more emphatic. During more aggressive encounters they make a high-hitched  "" weep "" . The song of the Least Flycatcher is a very short and distinctive, dry  "" chebec "" given by males and sometimes females that sounds more like a call. The song consists of two notes that each last less than a quarter of a second. They repeat each song, sometimes singing as many as 60  "" chebecs "" per minute."
Least Grebe,Tachybaptus dominicus,Podicipedidae,Podicipediformes,24.5,"Males in courtship give a high-pitched  "" gamp "" when courting females and a nasal  "" nye-nye-nye-nye "" during the rushing ceremony, part of courtship. Various other quiet calls are heard only around the nest. Pairs give a rapid trill in duet. Though not technically a song, this duet serves many of the same functions."
Least Sandpiper,Calidris minutilla,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,14,"Outside of the breeding season, Least Sandpipers give a high-pitched  "" creep "" call. They also give loud trills as part of predator distraction displays, as well as thin  "" seeet "" alarm calls. On the breeding grounds, Least Sandpipers make a songlike sequence of rich trills and high notes, sung by males (and sometimes females)."
Least Tern,Sternula antillarum,Laridae,Charadriiformes,22,"Alarm call a sharp  "" zwreep. ""  Also a high-pitched  "" kee-zink, kee-zink. ""  "
Lesser Black-backed Gull,Larus fuscus,Laridae,Charadriiformes,58,"Calls are loud, clear bugling. "
Lesser Goldfinch,Spinus psaltria,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,10,"When mingling in a flock, Lesser Goldfinches make a very common contact call that's wheezy and descending, given one or two notes at a time. They also give a couple of  "" chit "" notes in flight. Males give a descending  "" tee-yer "" call to females during courtship. The male's breeding song is a jumble of clear notes mixed in with wheezes, trills, and stutters, lasting up to 10 seconds. Males incorporate snippets of the songs of many other species, including Ash-throated Flycatchers, Verdins, Curve-billed Thrashers, American Kestrels, scrub-jays, and many more."
Lesser Nighthawk,Chordeiles acutipennis,Caprimulgidae,Caprimulgiformes,21.5,"From ground perches during the breeding season, Lesser Nighthawks give a toadlike, somewhat eerie trill that lasts for around 7-13 seconds. In flight, they make a bleating whinny that almost sounds like a gurgled laugh, followed by a low muffled trill.  "
Lesser Prairie-Chicken,Tympanuchus pallidicinctus,Phasianidae,Galliformes,39.5,"The low booming of displaying males (sometimes called yodeling, bubbling, or gobbling) is made by air passing through the syrinx and amplified by the esophageal air sacs. Displaying males also give cackles, whoops, squeaks, whines, and clucks. Females cluck and cackle, particularly when in conflict with other females at leks. "
Lesser Scaup,Aythya affinis,Anatidae,Anseriformes,42.5,"Males are generally silent, but they make a soft gurgling sound and a faint  "" wee-o "" call during courtship. Females are much more vocal than males, giving a harsh, burry grunt and a grating bark. "
Lesser Yellowlegs,Tringa flavipes,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,25,"The most common call is a whistled single or double noted,  "" tu  "" or  "" tu-tu.  "" During the male's courtship display, he gives a repeated  "" pill-e-wee pill-e-wee,  "" often referred to as a yodel. This is rarely heard away from the breeding grounds. Several short whistled notes followed by a wavering jumble."
Lewis's Woodpecker,Melanerpes lewis,Picidae,Piciformes,27,"Lewis's Woodpeckers are relatively quiet compared to other woodpeckers. Males give a harsh  "" churr "" 3-8 times in quick succession primarily during courtship. Males and perhaps females chatter in a series of short squeaks throughout the year. The alarm call given by both males and females is a sharp squeaky burst.  "
Limpkin,Aramus guarauna,Aramidae,Gruiformes,68.2,"Males have especially long, looped tracheas, or windpipes, as cranes do. They use these to make loud, grating, piercing high-pitched screeches and wails "" .  "" During courtship feeding, or when spotting a predator such as an alligator, Limpkins produce rattling calls. Females in many contexts give a soft  "" gon  "" call, frequently in a slowing series as the mate delivers a rhythmic, cranelike chorus of its wails. This duet is not quite a song but is memorable—numerous writers of natural history and fiction have been moved to describe the chilling sensations produced by this sound, especially at night. "
Lincoln's Sparrow,Melospiza lincolnii,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,14,"Males and females give a high-pitched, insectlike  "" zeet "" and a more aggressive sounding  "" chip "" . Lincoln's Sparrows are one of the most musical sparrows. Males sing a rich wrenlike song of trills, gurgles, and buzzes from exposed perches or tucked inside a shrub. Each song starts off with 2 or 3 bell-like notes before bursting into bubbly trills and gurgles that rapidly change pitch. The song ends with a thin slurred trill as if the bird is running out of steam or perhaps running back into the willow thicket to hide. Each song lasts for about 2 seconds."
Little Blue Heron,Egretta caerulea,Ardeidae,Pelecaniformes,65,"Little Blue Herons are usually silent, but they can utter hoarse, harsh squawks and croaks. "
Little Gull,Hydrocoloeus minutus,Laridae,Charadriiformes,29.5,"Short, hard, nasal  "" kek "" ; repeated. "
Loggerhead Shrike,Lanius ludovicianus,Laniidae,Passeriformes,21.5,"Both sexes utter a variety of muttered trills, stutters and scolds. Loggerhead Shrikes sing quiet songs composed of a rhythmic series of short trills, rasps, and buzzes mixed with clear, often descending notes. Both males and females perform a territory song, similar to the spring song but rougher and harsher."
Long-billed Curlew,Numenius americanus,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,57.5,"The alarm and contact call of male and female Long-billed Curlews is a harsh whistled  "" cur-lee "" , rising on second note; given year-round. They also give a rapid whistled tremolo with a slight stuttering quality to it. Song starts with a low whistled  "" prreee "" and builds into a louder  "" prprprprpr prrreeep prrreeep prrreeerr "" ."
Long-billed Dowitcher,Limnodromus scolopaceus,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,29,"Diagnostic call is a quick, high-pitched  "" keek "" , sometimes given several times in succession. A feeding flock often calls incessantly but softly (Short-billed flocks do not), sounding almost like an excited group of woodland birds. Less often heard is a quiet  "" tu "" , which can also be given in series and superficially resembles call of Short-billed. Males sing a complex series of piping phrases such as  "" peet-peet "" ;  "" pee-ter-wee-too "" , lasting about 1.5 seconds."
Long-billed Thrasher,Toxostoma longirostre,Mimidae,Passeriformes,27.5,"A low, scolding  "" chzzz ""  and a sharp  "" tchuk "" that sound very similar to the common calls of Brown Thrasher. Also makes a descending  "" kleak "" , a whistled  "" cheeooep "" , and a rising  "" toe-ree.

Long-eared Owl,Asio otus,Strigidae,Strigiformes,37.5,"The female's nest call is higher pitched than the male's advertising song, and richer in harmonics; it sounds more like a bleating lamb, or like blowing through a comb and paper. Both sexes utter a variety of alarm calls, including barks, squeals, and a gruff, catlike mew. Long-eared Owls are silent most of the year, but during breeding season they draw on a complex repertoire analogous to a songbird's song. Males give a series of 10 to more than 200  "" whoo "" notes evenly spaced about 2-4 seconds apart. This deep and forceful utterance, akin to the sound made by blowing across the lip of a very large bottle, can be heard more than half a mile away."
Long-tailed Duck,Clangula hyemalis,Anatidae,Anseriformes,43.5,"The incessant yodeling call of the Long-tailed Duck is one of their defining characteristics. The call is a hooting  "" ahr-ahrouleet,  "" or  "" Tom-Connolly "" , which is also one of this species' colloquial names. "
Long-tailed Jaeger,Stercorarius longicaudus,Stercorariidae,Charadriiformes,50.5,"Gives a long series of around 20 shrill notes that start off short and become drawn out during the middle of the call, ending with shorter notes again. The call can last 10 seconds.  "
Louisiana Waterthrush,Parkesia motacilla,Parulidae,Passeriformes,15.25,"Louisiana Waterthrush's most often heard call note is a sharp, metallic chip "" ,  "" higher in pitch than that of Northern. Both sexes also give a  "" zizz "" call, during courtship or conflict. A soft  "" chut-chut-chut "" contact call has also been recorded. Males sing a primary song that commences with 2-4 sweet, clear, descending whistles; these introductory notes usually have two slurred elements. The remainder of the song is a pleasant jumble that varies between singers. An extended song, heard mostly during territorial conflicts, adds several more phrases to the primary song. Like Northern Waterthrush, Louisiana also has a flight song, sometimes delivered at dusk. In the flight song, the bird begins with a rapid series of chips, which becomes a rapid twitter before the song is given high in the air, usually a faster version of the primary song. Nesting females occasionally also sing primary song."
Lucifer Hummingbird,Calothorax lucifer,Trochilidae,Caprimulgiformes,NA,"Chip notes, often strung together in pairs or series.  Also a quiet  "" brzhee-brzhee. ""  "
Lucy's Warbler,Leiothlypis luciae,Parulidae,Passeriformes,10.5,"Both sexes give a quick, high-pitched, metallic  "" tzip "" . Males sing a set of three (sometimes two) trills, varying in pitch and speed. The song recalls those of related species such as Virginia's and Nashville."
MacGillivray's Warbler,Geothlypis tolmiei,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"Both sexes give a distinctive  "" tsik  "" call note. Foraging birds regularly give this call, very unlike Mourning Warbler, which tends to forage silently. Males sing a fast series of burry, rising phrases, often written as  "" churry churry churry churry cheery cheery "" and lasting about 1.5 seconds "" .  "" Heard much less often is a flight song, which is similar but mixed with a jumble of rapid call notes."
Magnificent Frigatebird,Fregata magnificens,Fregatidae,Suliformes,101.5,"Magnificent Frigatebirds are usually silent at sea, but sometimes give a grating call when coming in for a landing or while fighting with each other above the colony. Males make guttural drumming sounds during courtship. Juveniles beg for food with harsh screams.  "
Magnolia Warbler,Setophaga magnolia,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12,"Males and females call with a nasal  "" zic "" or  "" zeep "" . During nocturnal migration they give a buzzy  "" zeet "" . Male Magnolia Warblers sing a very short, 1-second song; a whistled  "" weta, weta, WETA "" , with the last notes generally being the loudest and most emphatic. The first notes in the song are fast, alternating between higher and lower pitches, ending with an emphatic slide. They also sing a second type of song at dawn and dusk that lacks the louder final note."
Mallard,Anas platyrhynchos,Anatidae,Anseriformes,57.5,"The quintessential duck's quack is the sound of the female mallard. Females often give this call in a series of 2-10 quacks that begin loudly and get softer. When courting, she may give a paired form of this quack. The male does not quack; instead he gives a quieter, rasping, one- or two-noted call. Ducklings make soft, shrill whistles when alarmed. "
Mangrove Cuckoo,Coccyzus minor,Cuculidae,Cuculiformes,30," Song a series of nasal, guttural  "" ahrr ""  notes."
Marbled Godwit,Limosa fedoa,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,45,"On the breeding grounds, males give a  "" ger-whit "" often during display flights, but also from the ground. Males and females also give a  "" rad-i-ca "" call on the breeding grounds, especially during courtship. On the nonbreeding grounds, males and females give a nasal call that sounds a bit like they are laughing.  "
Marbled Murrelet,Brachyramphus marmoratus,Alcidae,Charadriiformes,24.5,"Marbled Murrelets produce a dozen different calls, both in the nesting area and at sea. The most commonly heard calls are a piercing  "" keer "" , sometimes drawn out, and a plaintive, whining or buzzy whistle. At the nest, adults also give high, sharp piping whistles. "
Marsh Wren,Cistothorus palustris,Troglodytidae,Passeriformes,12,"Males and females call to alert each other of danger and to indicate their location. The call is a grating, somewhat buzzy "" chit "" . In flight, males and females give a longer series of nasal calls.  Males sing a rapid series of gurgling and buzzy trills. Though each note may only last for 1-2 seconds, they can carry on for up to 20 minutes, hardly ever repeating the same note. Males in the eastern United States sing a more liquid and less harsh song than males in the West. Eastern males begin each song with a nasal buzz, whereas western males begin with a sharp chuck. Western males also have a more complex set of vocalizations. "
Masked Booby,Sula dactylatra,Sulidae,Suliformes,80,"Male makes high-pitched whistle, female gives louder and lower honk or trumpet. "
McCown's Longspur,Rhynchophanes mccownii,Calcariidae,Passeriformes,15,"The commonly heard calls are a quick  "" whit "" , a sharp, two-noted  "" prit-tup, "" and a dry rattle that recalls rattles of other longspurs and Snow Bunting. Males sing a tinkling, warbling song,  "" see, see, see me, see me, hear me, hear me, see. "" When sung in the air, this song is a bit more complex in structure than when it is sung on the ground. Females sometimes also sing a similar song from the nest."
Merlin,Falco columbarius,Falconidae,Falconiformes,27,"Both sexes give a shrill, chattering call that can last 4 seconds. It's used in courtship as well as aggressive situations. Merlins also have a short chip note used as a contact call and in courtship displays. The male's is higher pitched than the female's. "

Mississippi Kite,Ictinia mississippiensis,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,35.5,"The Mississippi Kite's call is a high, 2-syllable whistle: a quick note followed by a long one that trails down in pitch. It calls while flying or perched to advertise its presence, and uses a more emphatic version when a predator is present, often attracting other kites to join in. It may add extra syllables during interactions with its mate or nestlings. "
Monk Parakeet,Myiopsitta monachus,Psittacidae,Psittaciformes,49,"Monk Parakeets are very noisy animals with a vocabulary that consists of at least eleven types of calls. Their most characteristic sound is a chatter of short notes that they give while perched or at their nest. Birds in flight make a loud squawking, with many calling at once. Monk Parakeets kept in captivity can learn to mimic human speech. "
Montezuma Quail,Cyrtonyx montezumae,Odontophoridae,Galliformes,21.5,"Often silent.<strong> </strong>Females give a quavering, descending series of metallic whistles with an otherworldly quality; males give a similarly strange buzzy descending whistle that might be mistaken for an insect. Foraging coveys give soft, chicken-like purring, clucking, and moaning sounds. Song a descending whistle combined with a buzz."
Mottled Duck,Anas fulvigula,Anatidae,Anseriformes,53.6,"Similar to Mallard. Males give a low, raspy r "" aeb,  "" sometimes doubled, while females give a loud, raspy series of 6 or so quacks, descending in pitch and intensity.

Courting birds make a  "" gagg "" sound (female), sometimes in a series, and sharp whistles known as the burp-whistle and grunt-whistle (male).  "
Mountain Bluebird,Sialia currucoides,Turdidae,Passeriformes,18,"A soft, nasal, non-musical ' "" tew "" ' or ' "" peu "" ' note, and a high-pitched ' "" tink "" ' to communicate alarm. Mountain Bluebirds have a simple repertoire of two song types. At dawn, often while flying, they sing a loud, emphatic, chirruping song similar to that of the American Robin. Throughout the day, they perform a soft, repetitious warbling that can last many minutes."
Mountain Chickadee,Poecile gambeli,Paridae,Passeriformes,12.5,"Chickadees are extremely vocal. The most famous call is the one that gave the birds their name, a lively  "" chick-a-dee "" used while mobbing predators, chasing rivals, singing, and staying in contact with a flock. They often repeat parts of the call, particularly the  "" dee "" , and research on Black-capped Chickadees has suggested chickadees do this to emphasize the threat from a predator. Among their other calls is a burbling, half-swallowed  "" gargle "" exchanged when two individuals face off or between mates. A sweet whistled song,  "" fee-bee "" with the second note lower than the first, similar to the whistles of many other chickadees. Mountain Chickadees sometimes sing more than one  "" fee "" and/or more than one  "" bee "" notes as well. Though they sound quite similar to Black-capped Chickadees, research has shown that the two species pay little attention to each other's calls. You'll mainly hear this song in summer."
Mountain Plover,Charadrius montanus,Charadriidae,Charadriiformes,22,"Generally quiet. A  "" kip "" or  "" poit "" flight call can be heard year-round. Also gives low, harsh scolding calls when disturbed. Courting males give a low mooing call and a soft, low  "" chert "" . Both sexes make a whistled  "" wee-wee  "" during courtship. "
Mountain Quail,Oreortyx pictus,Odontophoridae,Galliformes,28.5,"The most commonly heard call is a liquid  "" wit "" whistle, repeated by a bird that is crouched below a dominant, standing bird, as part of either courtship or conflict. Contact calls include sharp, repeated whistles. These help quail to gather together after being separated. Males repeatedly sing a loud, pure-toned, descending  "" QUEE-ar!  "" This distinctive song (sometimes termed a call) begins in spring and mostly concludes when eggs hatch. Males give this call on occasion at other times, perhaps when in conflict with other males."
Mourning Dove,Zenaida macroura,Columbidae,Columbiformes,28.5,"You can often hear paired males give the three-parted 'nest call' while nest-building: a  "" coo-OO-oo "" , highest in the middle. Females sometimes call  "" ohr ohr "" while sitting on the nest. The song (or 'perch-coo') is given mainly by unmated males from a conspicuous perch. It's a soft  "" coo-oo "" followed by two or three louder coos."
Mourning Warbler,Geothlypis philadelphia,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"A loud, rich "" tsip. "" The primary song is a rapid, burry, rollicking  "" churry churry churry churry chorry chorry "" , with each phrase rising in pitch. This song varies regionally across the species' large range. Flight song is similar but often includes rapid chipping."
Muscovy Duck,Cairina moschata,Anatidae,Anseriformes,75,Muscovy Ducks are usually silent. Females give a quiet quack or croak when frightened and a soft shrill call to communicate with ducklings. Males hiss and puff during courtship. 
Mute Swan,Cygnus olor,Anatidae,Anseriformes,139.5,"Mute Swans aren't mute, but their hoarse, muffled trumpet or bugle call given during territorial defense doesn't carry like the calls of other swan species. Mute Swans also make an explosive snorting or hissing when threatened or disturbed. Mates greet each other with a short, snoring sound, and females solicit their mates with a slow  "" glock, glock "" call. Female swans call to their broods with a sound like a yapping puppy. When in a group Mute Swans growl, whistle, and snort at each other. Cygnets whistle a soft, low-volume contact call when preening or feeding with adults, and peep noisily at a high pitch when distressed or lost. "
Nashville Warbler,Leiothlypis ruficapilla,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12,"A musical, dry  "" chip "" and a more metallic  "" tink. "" Only the male Nashville Warbler sings, a rich and resonant two-parted song consisting of several two-part phrases followed by a lower trill— "" see-bit see-bit see-bit see-bit see-bit titititititi. "" "
Nelson's Sparrow,Ammospiza nelsoni,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,12,"Calls of Nelson's Sparrow sound similar to chip notes of Saltmarsh Sparrow, a soft, sweet  "" tic  "" or  "" tuc "" , sometimes given in series. Males deliver a raspy  "" pssssssssssstk "" , sounding like a short burst of steam escaping a pipe, as well as other similar songs that may sound like a hissing buzz or a wheezy, hushed, or choking gasp. All three subspecies frequently sing at night. Males commonly sing a flight song giving a series of  "" tic "" calls as they fly upward, then delivering the standard song at the apex of their arc and fluttering in mid-air. Then they descend, singing once more before landing. Singing is not territorial but serves to advertise dominance, both to females and other males. Female Nelson's Sparrows sometimes sing."
Neotropic Cormorant,Phalacrocorax brasilianus,Phalacrocoracidae,Suliformes,61,"A distinctive low-pitched guttural grunting, likened to the oinking of a pig. "

Northern Bobwhite,Colinus virginianus,Odontophoridae,Galliformes,NA,"Both sexes use sharp whistles and soft contact calls to stay in touch with each other while moving and foraging. Adults point out food items to their chicks with a soft  "" tu-tu-tu "" . Males and females give a loud whistled  "" bob-white "" that sweeps upward in pitch; the song is used mostly by unmated males during the breeding season."
Northern Cardinal,Cardinalis cardinalis,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,22,"Scientists have described at least 16 different calls for the Northern Cardinal, but the one you'll hear most commonly is a loud, metallic chip. Cardinals make this call when warning off intruders to their territory, when predators are near, as females approach their nests, and by both sexes as they carry food to the nest or when trying to get nestlings to leave the nest. When one member of a pair is about to feed the other, either bird may make a softer  "" took "" note. Both male and female Northern Cardinals sing. The song is a loud string of clear down-slurred or two-parted whistles, often speeding up and ending in a slow trill. The songs typically last 2 to 3 seconds. Syllables can sound like the bird is singing  "" cheer, cheer, cheer "" or  "" birdie, birdie, birdie "" . Males in particular may sing throughout the year, though the peak of singing is in spring and early summer."
Northern Flicker,Colaptes auratus,Picidae,Piciformes,29.5,"Flickers make a loud single-note call, often sounding like  "" kyeer "" , about a half-second long. When birds are close together and displaying they may make a quiet, rhythmic  "" wick-a, wick-a "" call. Northern Flickers make a loud, rolling rattle with a piercing tone that rises and falls in volume several times. The song lasts 7 or 8 seconds and is quite similar to the call of the Pileated Woodpecker.

Northern Goshawk,Accipiter gentilis,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,58.5,"Adult goshawks give a rapid-fire  "" ki-ki-ki-ki "" alarm call repeated 10-20 times in response to threats or when chasing prey. They sometimes precede the call with a drawn-out  "" kreey-a "" . When defending the nest, the female's call can intensify to a constant scream. Both males and females also use three variations of a wailing  "" kree-ah "" : members of a pair call to each other when the male enters the territory (often announcing himself with a single-note call), and the female gives a shorter version of the wail when her partner brings food to the nest. Once he delivers the prey, she gives a slower, clipped  "" kree-ah "" and continues calling until he leaves the area. "
Northern Harrier,Circus hudsonius,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,48,"Males and females both give a fast series of  "" kek "" notes lasting 1-2 seconds during courtship displays. When threatened by nest predators or mobbed by small birds, they use higher-pitched  "" kek "" notes.

Northern Hawk Owl,Surnia ulula,Strigidae,Strigiformes,40.5,"Their alarm call is a harsh screech followed by a faster and repeated raspy  "" kip "" . Fledglings give a high-pitched scream.  Males sing a rolling whistled  "" ulululululul "" , that lasts around 14 seconds during display flights to attract a mate. Females have a similar, but shorter and hoarser song."
Northern Mockingbird,Mimus polyglottos,Mimidae,Passeriformes,23.5,"Northern Mockingbirds make a harsh, dry  "" chew "" or  "" hew "" when mobbing nest predators or chasing other mockingbirds. Mates exchange a softer version of this call during incubation and nestling periods, or when the female leaves the nest while incubating. Mockingbirds also make a series of 2-8 short, scratchy  "" chat "" calls to warn off intruders. Females make a single  "" chat "" when disturbed. Both male and female mockingbirds sing. They often mimic the sounds of birds (and frogs) around them, including shrikes, blackbirds, orioles, killdeer, jays, hawks, and many others. They go on learning new sounds throughout their lives. The song is a long series of phrases, with each phrase repeated 2-6 times before shifting to a new sound; the songs can go on for 20 seconds or more. Many of the phrases are whistled, but mockingbirds also make sharp rasps, scolds, and trills. Unmated males are the most insistent singers, carrying on late all day and late into the night. Brown Thrashers have a similar song, but the phrases are less varied and most are delivered just 2-3 times. Gray Catbirds can also sound similar, but their phrases are more nasal, hurried, and slurred."
Northern Parula,Setophaga americana,Parulidae,Passeriformes,11.5,"Males and females give a sharp chip during aggressive encounters and while foraging.  Northern Parulas sing 2 different types of songs. The most common is a rising buzzy trill with a final sharp note. This song rises up and pinches off sharply at the end. The second song has distinct pauses in between bouts of the rising buzzy trill. Males are the primary vocalists, but females may occasionally sing. Parulas sing often while hopping between braches in the middle to upper levels of the forest. "
Northern Pintail,Anas acuta,Anatidae,Anseriformes,63.5,"Throughout the year, male Northern Pintails give a short burst that sounds similar to a wheezy trainlike whistle. Females often make a rough stuttering quack similar to a Mallard.  "
Northern Pygmy-Owl,Glaucidium gnoma,Strigidae,Strigiformes,17,"The call is a rapid, high-pitched, short trill that often precedes the song. Song is a series of high, hollow toots spaced 1-2 seconds apart. Males and females sometimes duet, singing simultaneously."
Northern Rough-winged Swallow,Stelgidopteryx serripennis,Hirundinidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Generally quiet, except during nest building and egg laying, when they give a soft, slightly rising liquid  "" churt "" . Its rarely heard song is faint, gurgling, and hoarse sounding. "
Northern Saw-whet Owl,Aegolius acadicus,Strigidae,Strigiformes,19.5,"Saw-whets give whines, guttural sounds, high  "" tssst "" calls, squeaks, and high-pitched barks. Northern Saw-whet Owls have a distinctive  "" too-too-too "" song, an insistent series of whistled notes on roughly the same pitch, given at a rate of about 2 notes per second. Males calling to advertise their territory can be heard up to half a mile away. Other males respond with a softer, faster, lower version of the song. Females also use a version of the song during courtship."
Northern Shoveler,Spatula clypeata,Anatidae,Anseriformes,47.5,"Males give a wheezy  "" took-took "" during courtship, in flight, and when alarmed. Females make a nasal-sounding quack typically during courtship and throughout the breeding season.   "
Northern Shrike,Lanius borealis,Laniidae,Passeriformes,23.5,"Shrikes call very little on the wintering grounds unless warning or attacking an intruder in the territory: a harsh  "" ack "" (directed at most birds), a whistled  "" breezeek  "" (directed at raptors or other shrikes), or a jaylike  "" jaay "" (directed at mammals). Nesting shrikes are very vocal; they use nasal  "" wake "" and  "" woot "" calls during courtship feeding and when feeding young, as well as a variety of other calls in different contexts. On the breeding grounds, both male and female sing softly, a long, complex, thrasher-like series of phrases. The phrases may be sweet (warbles, whistles, trills) or harsh (buzzes, gargles, screeches, chatters). Most birds include imitations of species that nest in the vicinity. Year round, both sexes also sing a louder, simpler, shorter song in which they sing each phrase twice, very like some thrashers."
Northern Waterthrush,Parkesia noveboracensis,Parulidae,Passeriformes,13,"The most commonly heard call is a loud, metallic  "" chink "" similar to the call of Louisiana Waterthrush but a bit lower in pitch. Courting adults and begging young also give a high-pitched  "" zeez "" call. The primary song is a loud, ringing, three-part  "" sweet sweet sweet swee wee wee chew chew chew chew "" with many minor variations. Breeding males deliver a delightful flight song, especially around dusk, which starts with a fast series of chips and climaxes in a jumbled, rapid mix of song fragments and calls. Some individuals deliver this song while ascending rapidly through the canopy."
Northwestern Crow,Corvus caurinus,Corvidae,Passeriformes,43.2,"The most often-heard call is a nasal  "" craah,  "" lower in pitch than the familiar  "" caw "" of American Crow. The larger male gives a lower-pitched call than the female. Among many other calls are a groan given by females and nestlings receiving food, a mechanical, rattling "" errrrr  "" (similar to other crows), a high-pitched 'falsetto' call, and several other short calls usually heard during the breeding season. "
Nuttall's Woodpecker,Dryobates nuttallii,Picidae,Piciformes,17,"Both sexes commonly give a short and high pitched  "" pit "" to communicate with each other. This short call forms the foundation of two other calls: a double note and a rattle. They give the metallic-sounding double  "" pitit "" note year-round, but more frequently in the winter and spring. The rattle is made up of 14-45  "" pit "" notes strung together and given in rapid succession. They typically rattle from October-May. Nuttall's Woodpeckers also make a harsh shrieking call during courtship that sounds similar to the call of an American Kestrel. "
Oak Titmouse,Baeolophus inornatus,Paridae,Passeriformes,NA,"Males and females are highly vocal, chattering from elevated perches mostly to defend territories from other Oak Titmice. These calls include both high- and low-pitched notes, some shrill and some scratchy. Oak Titmice also make lisping notes during foraging, hissing and puffing sounds to defend the nest, twittering during courtship, and shrill notes when flushed from a roost. Oak Titmice males sing several songs, all involving sharp, robust notes, both high and low, in repeated sequences with a steady tempo. Males sing infrequently in the nonbreeding season, singing more and more as spring approaches. Females are capable of singing but do so only rarely."
Olive Sparrow,Arremonops rufivirgatus,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,14.25,"Both males and females make a metallic call note.  Olive Sparrows sing an accelerating series of chips that sounds like a bouncing ping-pong ball, often with a metallic quality. Sometimes the end of the song drops in pitch, other times the song is evenly pitched. Olive Sparrows typically sing from hidden perches close to the ground, so even singing birds can be hard to locate. They tend to be more vocal from May to June, but in Costa Rica they sing during the wet and dry seasons from March-October. "
Olive Warbler,Peucedramus taeniatus,Peucedramidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"The call is a single high-pitched, hollow-sounding  "" peew "" .  Male and female Olive Warblers sing a burry song of 2 repeated notes on different pitches. Sometimes the first note is lower than the second, but other times it is reversed.

Olive-sided Flycatcher,Contopus cooperi,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,19,"The most frequently heard call is a sharp  "" pip "" , usually given three times in quick succession but sometimes 2 or 4 times or in very rapid staccato series or even a twitter, given by both sexes. Males involved in clashes with other males utter growling or gurgling sounds or squeaks. The distinctive whistled song was famously rendered  "" quick "" ,  "" three beers! "" by early field guide authors. Males give this song throughout the breeding season but most consistently and frequently early in the season. Some apparently unmated males give variations on the song, and females also sing occasionally when nesting commences, though their song is not as loud or ringing as the male's. Even fledglings sing weakly at times."
Orange-crowned Warbler,Leiothlypis celata,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"The Orange-crowned Warbler call is a simple, sharp, high-pitched chip, distinctive from that of other warblers. Males and females give the call when foraging, and females call when flushed from the nest or when the nest is threatened. Male Orange-crowned Warblers sing a trilling song of sweet, clear notes. The song can remain on a single pitch or it can rise slightly in the middle and end on a distinctive rising or falling note— "" chee chee chee chew chew "" . The song pattern varies enough that individual males can be told apart by the version they sing."
Orchard Oriole,Icterus spurius,Icteridae,Passeriformes,16.5,"Calls include a soft  "" chuk "" and a quick chatter. Females and fledglings call with a simple, short whistle. The Orchard Oriole's song is a series of loud, clear whistles with a sing-song phrasing similar to (but more varied than) an American Robin. These notes are often interspersed with harsh, chattering notes. The song lasts about 3-4 seconds. Males sing mainly to attract mates rather than to defend territories."
Osprey,Pandion haliaetus,Pandionidae,Accipitriformes,56,"Ospreys have high-pitched, whistling voices. Their calls can be given as a slow succession of chirps during flight or as an alarm call—or strung together into a series that rises in intensity and then falls away, similar to the sound of a whistling kettle taken rapidly off a stove. This second type of call is most often given as an unfamiliar Osprey approaches the nest. As the perceived threat increases, the call can build in intensity to a wavering squeal. "
Ovenbird,Seiurus aurocapilla,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"Males and females give several kinds of short call notes. Almost all are used only by one sex or the other. Distinctly male calls include  "" ple-bleep "" and  "" whink "" notes used in male-male encounters and in male-female chases. Female calls include a high  "" tsip "" that may serve chiefly to identify her as a female in male-female interactions. A series of  "" tsip "" calls after a male song associates a female with a particular male. The sexes share a  "" chep "" call used for communication between them as well as in chases. The primary mating and territorial song of the male Ovenbird is a rapid, resounding  "" tea-cher, Tea-cher, TEA-cher "" growing louder over the first few repetitions, with 8 to 13 teacher phrases in all. Pitch, speed, and emphasis of syllables in the 2.5-4 second song vary among individuals. To our ears, some may sound more like  "" tea-tea-tea "" , and others more like  "" teachier, teachier "" . Males use a shorter song during chases, attacks, and copulation attempts. This song is longer and more varied, starting with a series of short notes, followed by a complex ramble of  "" teacher "" phrases and  "" ple-bleep "" notes. Males also give a distinctive flight song at dusk that differs from the typical song, though includes a few ‘teacher' phrases in it."
Pacific Golden-Plover,Pluvialis fulva,Charadriidae,Charadriiformes,24.5,"Call a series of slow, slurred whistles with pauses between the phrases. Flight call a whistled  "" chu-eet, ""  with accent on the second syllable. "
Pacific Loon,Gavia pacifica,Gaviidae,Gaviiformes,66,"Pacific Loons are mostly quiet in fall and winter, though feeding birds sometimes give a short, sharp  "" ark "" , possibly a contact call. On the breeding grounds, the most memorable call is an eerie, wailing  "" oo "" - "" loo "" - "" lee "" , audible over great distances and recalling the similar call of the Common Loon. Pacific Loons also have numerous loud, croaking calls, some of which sound like ravens, as well as other calls described as squealing, purring, clucking, cackling, and growling sounds, mostly heard at the nesting lake. "
Pacific Wren,Troglodytes pacificus,Troglodytidae,Passeriformes,10,"Male and female Pacific Wrens give one sharp check call similar to the call of a Wilson's Warbler. Their song is a sweet series of tumbling, trilling notes with a staccato quality. Pacific Wrens have a large catalog of complex songs. Males sing for 5 to 10 seconds, stringing together as many as 50 different phrases. They sing regularly during the breeding season from mid-April to August but irregularly during the nonbreeding season."
Pacific-slope Flycatcher,Empidonax difficilis,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,15.5,"The most commonly heard calls are a sweet, upslurred  "" peeWEET!  "" (male) and a high-pitched, short, sibilant  "" tsip "" (female). Males sing a high-pitched, three-part  "" ps-SEET ptsick tseet! "" "
Painted Bunting,Passerina ciris,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"Painted Buntings give soft  "" plik "" calls. The Painted Bunting's song is a series of short, musical phrases of thin, sweet, high-pitched notes lasting about 2 seconds. When establishing territorial boundaries in the spring, a male may sing 9-10 songs per minute from several perches within his territory. Neighboring males often sing back and forth at each other, a territorial behavior called countersinging."
Painted Redstart,Myioborus pictus,Parulidae,Passeriformes,14,"Call a loud, low-pitched  "" cheeyu, ""  widely described as similar to those of Pine Siskins, but quite unlike the calls of any other warblers Songs variable, generally consisting of repeated two-syllable phrases followed by one or more single-syllable chirps. "
Palm Warbler,Setophaga palmarum,Parulidae,Passeriformes,13,"They give two different types of calls: a thin  "" seep "" and a louder smack. They often give the thin  "" seep "" call in flight. The louder smack is often given as an alarm call. Male Palm Warblers sing a buzzy trill that some liken to a Chipping Sparrow song. The song is made up of 4-16 buzzy notes that each swell up in pitch slightly. Strung together, the notes have trilling quality. Each song lasts for about 1-3 seconds separated by 12-18 seconds of silence. Males often sing from atop trees and shrubs."
Parakeet Auklet,Aethia psittacula,Alcidae,Charadriiformes,24.5,Most frequently heard call is a whinny. Highly vocal at colony and when courting at sea. 
Parasitic Jaeger,Stercorarius parasiticus,Stercorariidae,Charadriiformes,45,"The main call is a series of 3 to 4 (sometimes up to 12) two-parted notes, given a bit faster than one per second on the ground or in flight. There's also a shorter, irregular series of staccato notes that may be given during attacks and chases. "
Pectoral Sandpiper,Calidris melanotos,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,NA,"Flushed and flying birds often give a low, sharp  "" churt  "" that is easily remembered once learned and very different from most other shorebirds' calls. Males courting females on the ground deliver a strange set of grating growls and higher-pitched squawks. Courtship song is a hollow hooting, interspersed with growling and squawking notes."
Pelagic Cormorant,Phalacrocorax pelagicus,Phalacrocoracidae,Suliformes,63.5,"Pelagic Cormorants are mostly silent except when breeding, when males give a purring or groaning call and gargling sounds. Females make clicking and croaking calls. "
Peregrine Falcon,Falco peregrinus,Falconidae,Falconiformes,42.5,"Alarm call a loud series of harsh  "" kak, kak, kak. ""  "
Phainopepla,Phainopepla nitens,Ptiliogonatidae,Passeriformes,19.5,"The most commonly heard call is a quiet  "" wurp "" that is given in many contexts. A hard trilling  "" churrrr "" is used mostly against other Phainopeplas intruding on territory; females give a softer version when soliciting courtship feeding. Males sing a many-syllabled rambling song that includes a distinctive whistled  "" wheedle-ah "" , given throughout the day from regular song perches."
Philadelphia Vireo,Vireo philadelphicus,Vireonidae,Passeriformes,11.6," Song a broken series of slurred notes. Each phrase usually ends in either a downslur or an upswing, as if the bird asks a question, then answers it, over and over. May repeat same phrase twice or more in a row."
Pied-billed Grebe,Podilymbus podiceps,Podicipedidae,Podicipediformes,34,"Pied-billed Grebes have an extremely variable vocal repertoire. Among the most commonly heard sounds are a long, loud, rhythmic series of bleating whoops, coos, and gulping  "" kuk-kuk-kuk "" notes; also a rippling, chuckling chatter. "
Pigeon Guillemot,Cepphus columba,Alcidae,Charadriiformes,32.5,"High-pitched, thin twitters and piping calls. Alarm call is a loud, wavering whistle. "
Pileated Woodpecker,Dryocopus pileatus,Picidae,Piciformes,44.5,"Pileated Woodpeckers are quite vocal, typically making a high, clear, series of piping calls that lasts several seconds. The sound is quite similar to a Northern Flicker's rattling call, although it tends to be more resonant and less even in tone, with changing emphasis or rhythm during the call. Pileated Woodpeckers also give shorter calls that sound like  "" wuk, wuk "" or  "" cuk, cuk "" to indicate a territory boundary or to give an alarm. "
Pine Grosbeak,Pinicola enucleator,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,22.5,"Song is a sequence of clear, warbling, flute-like notes. Flight calls vary geographically, but can sound like  "" tee-tee-tew, ""  resembling calls of Greater Yellowlegs. Males and very occasionally females sing a clear flutelike warble from the tops of trees. Their song is reminiscent of a Purple Finch, but it is slower and sounds richer and less harsh. Their warbling song rises and falls for around 2-5 seconds. Each song is made up of numerous notes that they rearrange on occasion, sometimes including imitations of other bird's songs. Captive birds in an outdoor aviary adopted parts of the songs of Carolina Wrens and Northern Cardinals."
Pine Siskin,Spinus pinus,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"Pine Siskin flocks are constantly atwitter with wheezy contact calls while feeding or in flight. Their most recognizable call is a  "" watch-winding ""  note, a harsh, upsweeping  "" zreeeeeeet "" lasting most of a second, tossed in amidst shorter calls. They utter a distinctive flight call, an explosive  "" zwee "" or  "" psee "" that initiates startled flight. In flight, a  "" tit-a-tit "" call often accompanies each flap-and-glide undulation. A single siskin can call back the flock with a solitary note. Females solicit copulation by uttering soft calls while bowing and fluttering tail and wing feathers. The female solicits feeding from the male with a low twittering call that carries well through the trees. Males string together husky, whispering trills, slurs, and short ascending notes into songs lasting 3-13 seconds. Songs are generally more nasal or wheezy than those of other finches. Song phrases are sometimes punctuated by  "" watch-winding ""  or  "" churry ""  notes (see Calls Description). Adult males can continue to add songs to their repertoires."
Pine Warbler,Setophaga pinus,Parulidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Males and females make sharp, short call notes. The males, and possibly the females as well, use a rattle call for territorial defense and other aggressive encounters. Male Pine Warblers sing a fast trill of 10-30 notes usually on one pitch, lasting a couple of seconds. The Pine Warbler is one of few North American songbirds that may sing at any time of year, including while migrating. The male usually sings while foraging or, during breeding season, from high branch tips of pines. The song is very similar to both Chipping Sparrow and Dark-eyed Junco songs, but tends to be a bit slower and more musical."
Pinyon Jay,Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus,Corvidae,Passeriformes,27.5,"Pinyon Jays constantly call to each other with nasal and crowlike "" kaws "" that sometimes have a quavering quality to them. They also give a louder staccato call when they sense danger.  "
Piping Plover,Charadrius melodus,Charadriidae,Charadriiformes,17.5,"During the breeding season, the male makes a high-pitched piping call in flight to declare ownership and to advertise to potential mates. The call is less than 1 second, but he repeats it about 4 times per second. He gives a similar call while he digs a small depression in the ground for a potential nest. If the male feels threatened on his territory, he makes a series of rattling, throaty sounds that increase in speed while bobbing his head. The male and female call to each other and their young with a quiet and brief  "" peep "" . "
Plain Chachalaca,Ortalis vetula,Cracidae,Galliformes,NA,"A raucous, hoarse, rising  "" cha-cha-lac "" given in overlapping rounds by members of a pair. This call is delivered in early morning and early evening. Other calls include chickenlike clucks, cackles, and purring sounds; alarm calls are higher-pitched squawks and squeals. "
Plumbeous Vireo,Vireo plumbeus,Vireonidae,Passeriformes,13,"Among the most often heard vocalizations outside the breeding season are harsh, raspy, almost grating alarm calls ( "" cha-cha-cha-cha "" ) that vary in intensity and duration. The male sings a burry song of ascending and descending phrases that can be rendered as  "" chree ch-richi-roo "" but with much variation in phrases. Cassin's Vireo songs are almost identical, but the first phrase of its songs tends to be more burry and hurried than in Plumbeous, which has a hoarse but slower song overall, very similar to the song of Yellow-throated Vireo."
Pomarine Jaeger,Stercorarius pomarinus,Stercorariidae,Charadriiformes,51.5,"The most common call is a series of up to 15 simple, gull-like notes given over about 5 seconds. Pomarine Jaegers also give a couple of varieties of alarm calls and, when feeding at sea, a sharp, 2-noted  "" which-yew. "" "
Prairie Falcon,Falco mexicanus,Falconidae,Falconiformes,42,"Prairie Falcons respond to a breeding territory intruder with a shrill, yelping,  "" kik-kik-kik "" alarm call; the tone, frequency and duration of the call vary amongst individuals. When investigating nest sites together, both members of a pair give a characteristic  "" eechup "" call. "
Prairie Warbler,Setophaga discolor,Parulidae,Passeriformes,11,"Calls vary; most common is a  "" chek ""  note. Song is a rapid series of ascending buzzes. "
Prothonotary Warbler,Protonotaria citrea,Parulidae,Passeriformes,NA,"The male and female give a sharp  "" tisk "" or  "" tschip "" call, often during aggressive interactions with other birds or nest predators. The female also calls when she leaves and returns to the nest. If a predator threatens the nest they make a high-pitched trill to distract the predator. When pairs interact they give a softer and thinner  "" tsip "" . The male has a loud, far-carrying song of 4-14 high-pitched ringing notes, sometimes likened to shouting 'tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet.' Each note is slightly upslurred and the series of notes increases in volume at the end. He frequently sings from elevated perches especially early in the morning, singing about 5-6 songs per minute. When close to the nest, his song is often softer; and when he's with a female he sings a longer song that starts off fast and slows down at the end."
Purple Finch,Haemorhous purpureus,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,14,"Typical call note is a short, low  "" tek "" . Males sing three kinds of songs, all including the rich, slurred warbling characteristic of finch songs. There's the  "" warbling song, ""  a fast, rising and falling string of 6-23 notes often sung while flocking. Males usually sing a  "" territory song ""  alone; it begins with a few notes on the same pitch before breaking into warbling and ending with a high, emphatic note. The third is an up-and-down cadence of 2-5 notes that sounds similar to a Red-eyed Vireo's whistled  "" hear-me?-see-me?-here-i-am "" . Females sing their own songs, a long 1-2 minute warbling from the nest."
Purple Gallinule,Porphyrio martinica,Rallidae,Gruiformes,35,"Purple Gallinules, like other rails, have a remarkable repertoire of vocalizations, most of them rather loud henlike cackling, laughing, or clucking similar to Common Gallinule but usually higher in pitch. Reedy calls are heard from nesting birds: a tinny, hornlike  "" chip "" , an abrupt  "" gheek! "" that sounds like a Limpkin, and  "" piu!  "" recalling Smooth-billed Ani and apparently used by parents to call young birds. Lower, more guttural or muttering calls that sound like  "" ka "" or  "" kerr "" are also described. "
Purple Martin,Progne subis,Hirundinidae,Passeriformes,19.5,"The building blocks of their songs are also used as calls, in a variety of situations. In addition, martins make a  "" hee-hee "" call while fighting over territories and  "" zwrack "" and  "" zweet "" calls during stressful interaction with other species. Females use a  "" choo "" call for leading fledglings. Purple Martins sing with boisterous, throaty chirps and creaky rattles. During courtship, males make a croak song that can be 4 seconds long; he only does this when a female is nearby, often before dawn and from inside the nest cavity. Females make a chortle song. The loudest song is the dawn song, which males sing before daylight, possibly to attract other martins to the colonial nest site."
Purple Sandpiper,Calidris maritima,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,21,"Interacting Purple Sandpipers often give squeaky, coarse  "" kee "" or  "" keer "" calls as well as a chuckling, descending chatter that recalls Semipalmated Sandpiper. Flight call is a low  "" kip "" . Nesting birds give many other vocalizations. Males in display flight over the territory deliver a rollicking, chortling song of repeated phrases "" .  "" This song does not closely resemble that of any other shorebird, but some elements have a grating quality that recalls Dunlin."
Pygmy Nuthatch,Sitta pygmaea,Sittidae,Passeriformes,10,"The most frequent call is a shrill, staccato piping, sounding a bit like Morse code or a rubber ducky being repeatedly squeezed. Pygmy Nuthatches also have other calls, including titters and high-pitched trills, which combine in a large flock to create a steady, conversation-like chattering. As in other nuthatch species, there is no concrete division between songs and calls. The Pygmy Nuthatch's song is a continuous repetition of its 'piping' call, lasting for more than 2 minutes."
Pyrrhuloxia,Cardinalis sinuatus,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,21,"Pyrrhuloxias make a sharp, metallic  "" cheek "" or  "" chip "" note, similar to that of the Northern Cardinal but lower in pitch. Other calls include a chattering contact call, a series of soft chipping notes during foraging, and a tseep call used by begging fledglings. Pyrrhuloxias often call while in flight. The Pyrrhuloxia's clear, whistled songs are very similar to those of the Northern Cardinal (one familiar example being the repeated  "" what-cheer "" song) though slightly softer and more reedy. Males have around a dozen songs, each 2-3 seconds long, which they sing frequently to establish and maintain territories. Two neighbors may sing in unison or alternately across a territory boundary. Females occasionally sing while defending nests."
Razorbill,Alca torda,Alcidae,Charadriiformes,43,Generally silent. Makes growling noises near nest. 
Red Crossbill,Loxia curvirostra,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,NA,"Variation in calls is one of the most prominent features of the many 'types' of Red Crossbill. The calls are fairly similar, but they look different with sound analysis software, and practiced listeners can tell some of the call types apart. The most often heard calls are those given in flight, which range from a short, dry  "" jip "" to a lower, slower, richer  "" toop "" . <a href= "" https://ebird.org/news/crossbills-of-north-america-species-and-red-crossbill-call-types/ "" >Here's more on the fascinating variation in crossbill call types.</a> Males (and rarely females) sing a variably sweet, loose trill or warble, usually preceded by several notes or paired notes that resemble flight calls."
Red Knot,Calidris canutus,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,25,"Birds flushed from the nest utter a quick  "" whit-whit "" . Males in conflict give a 'chatter yodel,' written  "" yeh-yeh-yeh "" , while males courting females produce a high  "" weeee "" . During most of the year, knots that are foraging or flushed simply give a nasal  "" knutt. "" Displaying males sing a flight song that is described as 'moaning' and 'flutelike,' a wistful  "" poorr-mee "" that becomes a series of  "" poorr-poorr "" , then culminates in  "" whip-poo-mee  "" as the flight display concludes, with the male gliding toward earth."
Red Phalarope,Phalaropus fulicarius,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,21,"On the breeding grounds, Red Phalaropes give several loud calls that can be heard from a half-mile or more away. These include a sharp, single  "" peet "" as an alarm; a slightly longer  "" zhee "" as a contact note used between pair members; and a softer twittering given by pair members, often given simultaneously. The flight call, a sharp  "" pit,  "" sometimes given in a string "" ,  "" is the only call given away from the breeding grounds. "
Red-bellied Woodpecker,Melanerpes carolinus,Picidae,Piciformes,24,"The Red-bellied Woodpecker's most common call is a shrill, rolling  "" kwirr "" or  "" churr "" given by both sexes. You might also hear a gruff, coughing  "" cha cha cha "" sounding through the woods, usually a contact call between mates, or a throaty growl exchanged when birds are close together. "
Red-breasted Merganser,Mergus serrator,Anatidae,Anseriformes,57.5,"When displaying, females give a raspy or croaking call while males give a catlike  "" meow "" . In flight females make a harsh  "" gruk "" . Otherwise Red-breasted Mergansers are generally silent. "
Red-breasted Nuthatch,Sitta canadensis,Sittidae,Passeriformes,11,"The  "" yank "" note can also be given as a call by both sexes (though more often by the male) as a way of communicating between the pair. This note can be sped up until it sounds like a vibrating trill, typically given from near the nest just at the end of nest excavation or beginning of egg-laying. During confrontations, chases or copulation, nuthatches may make a  "" phew "" call, and agitated birds sometimes make a wrenlike scolding call. Red-breasted Nuthatches sing a fast series of nasal, hornlike notes that sound like  "" yank-yank "" . Songs can have 6 or more of these notes each, and the songs themselves can be repeated up to 16 times per minute. It's unmated males that sing this most frequently. Males and females sometimes sing a similar but slower and harsher version of this song when they are defending their territory."
Red-breasted Sapsucker,Sphyrapicus ruber,Picidae,Piciformes,21,"Call a harsh mewing  "" waah. ""  Drumming a distinctive slow irregular tapping, easily imitated by tapping on a tree with a stick. "
Red-cockaded Woodpecker,Dryobates borealis,Picidae,Piciformes,21.5,"The best known call of this very vocal woodpecker is a raspy 'sklit' it gives when disturbed. Other calls include a 'churt' (repeated every 2-4 seconds) when flying into a roosting and nesting area, and a rattle that ends with a drop in pitch. Foraging birds give a soft, melodious chortling call when close to each other. "
Red-eyed Vireo,Vireo olivaceus,Vireonidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"A loud, catbird-like  "" myaah "" call punctuates many social interactions. Both sexes use it to emphasize warning displays toward potential predators or interlopers. Females incubating eggs may use the same call to attract the male, as well as a  "" tchet, tchet, tchet "" call to solicit food from him. Males use a second  "" tsherrrr "" call during fights and territorial displays. Song a broken series of slurred notes. Each phrase usually ends in either a downslur or an upswing, as if the bird asks a question, then answers it, over and over."
Red-faced Warbler,Cardellina rubrifrons,Parulidae,Passeriformes,14,"A sharp  "" chip "" recalling the call of Black-throated Gray Warbler. A ringing series of sweet-sounding notes that accelerates, rises, then drops in a final flourish, lasting about 2 seconds."

They call while perched or in flight, and call more frequently in the breeding season than at other times of year. Males and females also give a dry raspy chatter in flight to each other, especially early in the breeding season. This chatter can go on for as little as a few seconds to more than 10 seconds. They give a harsh and short squeal to attract a mate. "
Red-necked Grebe,Podiceps grisegena,Podicipedidae,Podicipediformes,49.5,"Males and females give a rapid, whinnying trill that sometimes becomes a louder braying or honking (during courtship or conflict), mostly on the breeding grounds. Mated pairs sometimes purr softly, and birds warning or attacking other waterbirds occasionally hiss. Wintering birds are seldom vocal, but they may call occasionally on calm days in late winter and early spring, as the breeding season approaches. "
Red-necked Phalarope,Phalaropus lobatus,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,18.5,"Typical calls are sharp, high-pitched single notes, sometimes strung together into a series. "
Red-shouldered Hawk,Buteo lineatus,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,52,"Call a loud  "" kee-aah, ""  with second note descending in pitch. Often given repeatedly.

Red-winged Blackbird,Agelaius phoeniceus,Icteridae,Passeriformes,20,"The typical call of a Red-winged Blackbird is a distinctive, matter-of-fact  "" check "" that's fairly easy to recognize. Males and females make these calls all year round, in flight and while feeding, when confronting rivals and to raise an alarm. They also give a more intense alarm call, a fast, scolding  "" chak chak chak "" . The male Red-winged Blackbird's  "" conk-la-ree! "" is a classic sound of wetlands across the continent. The 1-second song starts with an abrupt note that turns into a musical trill. Males often sing from a high perch while leaning forward, drooping their wings, spreading their tail feathers, and fluffing their bright shoulder patches to show them off.

No true song, but males are highly vocal during courtship displays and territorial defense, when they often deliver a so-called 'flight song,' a staccato series of guttural clucks."
Rock Sandpiper,Calidris ptilocnemis,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,21,"Makes trills and chattering calls. Song, usually given during display flights, is a rolling, repeated, throaty series of varied elements."
Rock Wren,Salpinctes obsoletus,Troglodytidae,Passeriformes,13.75,"Call a loud, dry trill, or a clear  "" tick-ear. ""  Song a series of repeated buzzy or musical phrases."
Rose-breasted Grosbeak,Pheucticus ludovicianus,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,19.5,"Rose-breasted Grosbeaks give short, sharp, penetrating chink calls, sometimes likened to the sound of a sneaker on a gym floor. They also give harsh, repeated squawks when alarmed. Both males and females sing a rich, sweetly whistled song. The pattern is similar to an American Robin's song, composed of many notes that alternately rise and fall. Most people describe the grosbeak's song as sweeter and more melodious than a robin's. The song can last 6 seconds and consist of 20 notes or syllables. Rose-breasted Grosbeaks are one of few bird species reported to sing while sitting on the nest. The female sings when nest-building, incubating, and brooding. The male often sings quietly from the nest and loudly from other high perches."
Roseate Spoonbill,Platalea ajaja,Threskiornithidae,Pelecaniformes,78.5,"Roseate Spoonbills are usually silent except at the breeding colonies. There, they make low grunting sounds when they are startled, while greeting their mates, and while feeding their young.  "
Roseate Tern,Sterna dougallii,Laridae,Charadriiformes,37,"A clipped, high-pitched  "" keek  "" is the most common call, with a lower  "" kir-ik  "" also common; alarmed birds at colonies also give a lower, harsher series of staccato calls. "
Ross's Goose,Anser rossii,Anatidae,Anseriformes,61.5,"Migrants in flight and at rest give a distinctive  "" keekkeek keek  "" call, higher in pitch than calls of Snow Geese, and a lower, grunting  "" hawh hawh "" . Alarm calls include a harsh  "" kork "" and a high-pitched squawk "" .  "" Paired adults give low grunts and moans. Some of these calls are rhythmically repeated. "
Ross's Gull,Rhodostethia rosea,Laridae,Charadriiformes,30,"Vagrants usually silent, but may give soft, high-pitched  "" kew. ""  "
Rough-legged Hawk,Buteo lagopus,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,49.5,"When nesting adults are alarmed they give a loud, catlike mew that lasts about 1 second, repeated every 15-30 seconds. They call while flying or perched. Courting birds give a whistle that tapers off into a hiss. "
Royal Tern,Thalasseus maximus,Laridae,Charadriiformes,47.5,"Both male and female of a pair give a loud, high-pitched  "" ka-rreet!  "" call during courtship and when returning to the colony. Courting birds also give a lower, sharp  "" aack  "" call. A shorter version of this also serves as an alarm or agitation call. Another alarm call is a high-pitched, sharp  "" keet-keet! "" "
Ruby-crowned Kinglet,Regulus calendula,Regulidae,Passeriformes,10,"The most common kinglet call is a harsh, fast, two-parted scold. They may also give a long, chattering series of short notes. Females sometimes do this as the male sings; females also use it as an alarm call. Male Ruby-crowned Kinglets sing a jumbled but distinctive song that builds to an incredibly loud ending when you consider how small these birds are. The song lasts about 5 seconds. It starts with soft, high notes that accelerate into a musical twittering, and then abruptly shifts into a loud series of 2- or 3-parted notes."
Ruby-throated Hummingbird,Archilochus colubris,Trochilidae,Caprimulgiformes,8,"A common call is an even  "" chee-dit "" exchanged between individuals or during chases. Males sing a constant series of monotonous chips just at daybreak."
Ruddy Duck,Oxyura jamaicensis,Anatidae,Anseriformes,39,"Ruddy Ducks are usually silent. The female gives a nasal call to beckon her brood, a high-pitched call to ward off amorous males, and a hiss when threatened. The male has only one call, a belch-like sound given during courtship displays. "
Ruddy Turnstone,Arenaria interpres,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,18.5,"Ruddy Turnstones are noisy and vocal shorebirds, and the male calls more frequently than the female. The most frequent call is a staccato chuckle or rattle which they give year-round in feeding groups, on the breeding grounds, and in flight. Alarm calls are sharp, metallic notes repeated irregularly either from the ground or in flight. The male also gives a longer chattering alarm call. "
Ruffed Grouse,Bonasa umbellus,Phasianidae,Galliformes,45,"Ruffed Grouse are mostly quiet, but they do make sounds. Female calls include a nasal squeal or hiss-like alarm call, and a  "" pete-pete-peta-peta "" call made before flushing. They quiet chicks with a scolding call and emit a low, cooing hum to gather their brood. Male calls include a hiss note, a  "" queet "" call prior to flushing, and a whining call triggered by females or other males near the drumming site. "
Rufous Hummingbird,Selasphorus rufus,Trochilidae,Caprimulgiformes,8,"Male and female Rufous Hummingbirds make a fast series of warning chip notes at intruding birds. Males performing a dive display for a female make a  "" chu-chu-chu-chu "" sound at the bottom of their dive. "
Rufous-crowned Sparrow,Aimophila ruficeps,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,15.5,"Paired individuals give a chattering series of calls to each other to stay in contact and strengthen their pair bond during nest building. They also make a harsh series of alarm calls in response to danger or while mobbing predators such as rattlesnakes. Males sing in spring and summer from exposed perches or while in flight.  They give two kinds of songs: one is a 1-2 second mix of slurs, chips, and chatters, with the bubbly quality of a House Wren song but much shorter. The other type of song is a simpler, fairly long trill."
Rufous-winged Sparrow,Peucaea carpalis,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Calls include a very high  "" tzeet ""  and short pips. Song is a series of short clear notes or longer whistles, followed by a trill."
Rusty Blackbird,Euphagus carolinus,Icteridae,Passeriformes,23,"Call note is a harsh  "" chek. ""  Song consists of two or three notes, followed by a higher, rising note, like the creak of rusty hinges."
Sabine's Gull,Xema sabini,Laridae,Charadriiformes,34,"A variety of calls, all very harsh, that sound like the grating alarm calls of smaller terns. "
Sage Thrasher,Oreoscoptes montanus,Mimidae,Passeriformes,21.5,"When alarmed, call is a low, hoarse cluck, very similar to a Red-winged Blackbird, accompanied by a flick of the tail. Occasionally gives a descending, clear, two-noted whistle, and a variety of scolding calls. Males have long, complex, melodic songs, with remarkable variety. The rambling series of phrases, often preceded by soft clucking notes, is continuous and interspersed with moments of repetition and mimicry. Songs can be very long indeed; one male was recorded singing for 22 minutes straight."
Sagebrush Sparrow,Artemisiospiza nevadensis,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Both sexes give a distinctive, bell-like  "" tink "" contact call, and use a similar, but more forceful note as an alarm call. The song is an abrupt series of several trills broken up by short chips, lasting about 2 seconds or less. Only males sing, and each male gives one song type which can vary by truncating the last syllables."
Saltmarsh Sparrow,Ammospiza caudacuta,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"This species has a variety of call notes, all short, many of them used only during the breeding season. Most often heard by birders are incisive, relatively high chip notes that sound like  "" tsip "" ,  "" tic "" , or  "" tuc.  "" Males sing a variable medley of quiet phrases and call notes that perhaps include imitations of other bird species. They sing from a perch in the saltmarsh or while flying between perches, and the song may last a few seconds to more than a minute. It is apparently only given when a female is nearby, not to mark territory.   "
Sanderling,Calidris alba,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,19,"Males call with croaking, frog-like trills before and during breeding display flights. Females signal their willingness to mate with a series of low buzzing notes that sound like a typewriter in motion. Adults of both sexes perform distraction displays, including snarls and cries, to lure predators away from the nest. Outside the breeding season, Sanderlings twitter in large flocks, each giving a series of soft, squeaky  "" wick wick "" notes. "
Sandhill Crane,Antigone canadensis,Gruidae,Gruiformes,120,"Sandhill Cranes give loud, rattling bugle calls, each lasting a couple of seconds and often strung together. They can be heard up to 2.5 miles away and are given on the ground as well as in flight, when the flock may be very high and hard to see. They also give moans, hisses, gooselike honks, and snoring sounds. Chicks give trills and purrs. "
Sandwich Tern,Thalasseus sandvicensis,Laridae,Charadriiformes,39.5,"A grating  "" kirr-ick. ""  "
Savannah Sparrow,Passerculus sandwichensis,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,13,"Like many grassland sparrows, this species uses short chip notes when alarmed, warding off intruders, or approaching its nest. A typical chip note is a soft, hissing  "" tss "" . During breeding season, the male sings a three-part song that lasts 2 to 3 seconds: opening with a few quick notes; then a high, thin, insect-like buzzy middle; and, ending with a quick lower trill."
Say's Phoebe,Sayornis saya,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,17,"The most common call note is the clear slurred whistle given without the burry note (see song description). Both sexes also chatter while interacting. <!--Call a  "" phee-eur. "" --> The song of the Say's Phoebe consists of 2 rather simple vocalizations repeated over and over: a clear, slurred whistle and a burry, hiccupping note. Each phrase is less than 1 second long, but they repeat the phrases for several minutes.<!--Song a low, whistled  "" pit-tsee-eur ""  alternated with a burry upslurred  "" churr-eep. "" -->"
Scaled Quail,Callipepla squamata,Odontophoridae,Galliformes,27.95,"The most frequently heard call is a nasal, rhythmic  "" tuck-too "" , with the first note higher, used as a contact call by both sexes. (In West Texas, locals call this the 'Pe-cos' call, after the Pecos River.) Males also use this call during courtship displays, along with the  "" whock "" call. When flushed, birds give a high cheeping call note. Males in search of a mate give a repeated, squealing  "" whock!, "" delivered from a perch such as a fence post. "
Scarlet Tanager,Piranga olivacea,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,16.5,"Both male and female Scarlet Tanagers give an energetic and very distinctive  "" chick-burr "" . They also give a descending screech call when attacking intruders, a soft call that rises in pitch during courtship and nesting, a twittering call when feeding or flying together, and a nasal whistle when arriving at the nest with food. The male Scarlet Tanager sings a burry series of 4-5 chirruping phrases with a hurried quality. Many people liken it to the sound of a robin with a sore throat. He sings from an exposed perch to defend his territory, getting into singing wars with his neighbors. Females sing a similar song but more softly and with fewer syllables. Mates often sing together while foraging or while the female is gathering nesting material."
Scissor-tailed Flycatcher,Tyrannus forficatus,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,29.5,"Their calls include squeaks, chirrs, and buzzy rattles. Scissor-tailed Flycatchers sing a series of sharp notes that sound rather like a puppy playing with a squeaky toy, rising in pitch and speeding up toward the end of the song. They sing from conspicuous perches like trees and wires. Like other flycatchers, Scissor-tailed Flycatchers probably do not learn their songs, but instead use innate cues."
Scott's Oriole,Icterus parisorum,Icteridae,Passeriformes,23,"A harsh, very nasal  "" chuk  "" is the most commonly heard call, with a softer, rising  "" wheet  "" also common. Both males and females sing a sweet, melodious series of whistles similar to the song of the Western Meadowlark."
Seaside Sparrow,Ammospiza maritima,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,14," Song is short, muffled, and ends in a buzz;  "" ttp, zhe, eeeeee, ""  like a distant Red-winged Blackbird."
Sedge Wren,Cistothorus platensis,Troglodytidae,Passeriformes,11,"Sharp chips followed by rapid chatter. Song is an accelerating series of 3 or 4 sharp chips, followed by a trill."
Semipalmated Plover,Charadrius semipalmatus,Charadriidae,Charadriiformes,18,"A short two-noted whistle,  "" chu-wee, ""  with second note higher. "
Semipalmated Sandpiper,Calidris pusilla,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,16.5,"Call a loud  "" cherk. ""  "
Sharp-shinned Hawk,Accipiter striatus,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,29,"The Sharp-shinned Hawk's typical call is a high-pitched, frantic  "" kik-kik-kik "" . It's used as an alarm call, during courtship, and by young birds just before they fledge. Nestlings and brooding females give a thin, high-pitched call to beg for food when the male brings prey to the nest. The Sharp-shinned Hawk has no true song, but males and females vocalize to each other during courtship with a plaintive squeal or a series of excited  "" kik-kik-kik "" calls. Because they are smaller, males tend to have higher voices than females. Mated pairs call to each other during the breeding season, making nesting the noisiest time for this usually silent bird."
Sharp-tailed Grouse,Tympanuchus phasianellus,Phasianidae,Galliformes,43.2,"The low cooing of displaying males is made by air passing through the syrinx and amplified by inflated air sacs in the neck. It is used to attract females to the lek, and less often after females have arrived at the lek. Displaying males also cluck (also made by females), bark, make a sound like a popping cork, gobble, and whine. Chicks give high-pitched peeping sounds when distressed. No song."
Shiny Cowbird,Molothrus bonariensis,Icteridae,Passeriformes,18,"Call a rolling chatter. Song a bubbling purring, followed by an ascending series of short, high notes."
Short-billed Dowitcher,Limnodromus griseus,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,27,"The most commonly heard call from all three subspecies is a distinctive, soft "" tu-tu-tu,  "" very unlike the high  "" keek "" of Long-billed Dowitcher and more similar to the more strident call of Greater Yellowlegs. The three subspecies have somewhat similar trilling or grating songs, a series of rising and falling phrases that repeat themselves with varying length and emphasis."
Short-eared Owl,Asio flammeus,Strigidae,Strigiformes,38.5,"Short-eared owls are not especially vocal. The primary call, a series of a dozen or more hoots, is given by males during courtship flight and also from the ground or from an elevated perch. Both males and females may bark, scream, or whine when defending the nest and offspring. Females sometimes utter a chickenlike cluck. "
Smith's Longspur,Calcarius pictus,Calcariidae,Passeriformes,16,"A short, dry rattling call and a short, sweet  "" siew "" . Males sing a sweet, somewhat scratchy, sparrowlike song of about 8 notes, closely resembling the songs of Fox Sparrow or American Tree Sparrow, which often sing in adjacent habitats."
Smooth-billed Ani,Crotophaga ani,Cuculidae,Cuculiformes,33,"High, nasal, rising  "" quer-leek "" call is the most commonly heard; this is sometimes written as  "" ah-nee "" and may be the source of the bird's name. Other calls include squeals, screams, barks, growls, and coughs heard in group interactions. "
Snail Kite,Rostrhamus sociabilis,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,37.5,"A rapid-fire  "" ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka "" , usually an alarm call. A softer  "" k-a-a-a-a-a "" call sounds like a sheep bleating, and an even softer  "" kuk-kuk "" may serve as a contact call. "
Snow Bunting,Plectrophenax nivalis,Calcariidae,Passeriformes,15,"Males and females give a clear  "" chew "" , a husky rolling rattle, a short buzz or snarl, and a sharp  "" chi-tik "" while foraging on the ground or in flight.  Male Snow Buntings sing a finchlike low and husky warble. Males sing in flight or while perched on a rock. "
Snow Goose,Anser caerulescens,Anatidae,Anseriformes,76,"Snow Geese are possibly the noisiest of all waterfowl. Their main call, made by both males and females, is a nasal, one-syllable honk given at any hour of the day or night, at any time of year, in the air or on the ground. Distant calling flocks are reminiscent of a pack of baying hounds. Birds less than a year old have a clearer and higher-pitched whistle. Family groups use a series of guttural notes to communicate with each other while feeding. Parents make a fast, quiet series of notes as a brood call to round up goslings. During nesting, they use a penetrating alarm call that varies in intensity. The flight call is a continuous chorus of shrill cries, hoarse honks, and high-pitched quacks, audible both day and night. "
Snowy Egret,Egretta thula,Ardeidae,Pelecaniformes,61,"Snowy Egrets are quiet except on breeding sites, where they give raspy or nasal calls, including loud, harsh squawks to signal aggression. "
Snowy Owl,Bubo scandiacus,Strigidae,Strigiformes,61.5,"In defense, Snowy Owls will hoot, whistle, and hiss. Both sexes, but particularly the males, make low, powerful, slightly rasping hoots. They're often given two at a time but may include up to six hoots in a row. These can be heard for up to 7 miles on the tundra, and other owls often answer with hoots of their own."
Snowy Plover,Charadrius nivosus,Charadriidae,Charadriiformes,16,"Call a husky, trilling  "" purrt, ""  and a whistled  "" tur-weet, ""  accented on the second syllable. "
Solitary Sandpiper,Tringa solitaria,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,21,"The most commonly heard call is a sharp  "" wheet "" or  "" wheet-wheet-wheet,  "" similar to that of Spotted Sandpiper but lower and more even in pitch. On the nesting grounds, researchers have described similar alarm calls, a quiet contact call, a loud chatter call, and a long whistle. Males sing both while perched and in flight. The basic song is a series of short, high-pitched whistles that suddenly increases in frequency at about the middle. A more elaborate song, only given in flight, adds on a series of similar but rapidly ascending whistles."
Song Sparrow,Melospiza melodia,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,14.5,"Song Sparrows have a sharp chip note to indicate alarm or anxiety; both sexes make it when excited or if predators approach a nest. Females make a harsh chatter at their mates during nest-building, or at a female intruding on the territory. Young or subordinate birds make a softer,  "" tsip "" note. The Song Sparrow sings a loud, clanking song of 2-6 phrases that typically starts with abrupt, well-spaced notes and finishes with a buzz or trill. In between, the singer may add other trills with different tempo and quality. The song usually lasts 2-4 seconds. Patterns of songs vary over the species' enormous range, so the Song Sparrows you hear when traveling may not sound quite like those from your hometown."
Sooty Grouse,Dendragapus fuliginosus,Phasianidae,Galliformes,45,"Males advertise their territory with a low-pitched, loud hoot or series of them. They give this vocalization to mark territory and to attract females, so some authors refer to this as 'song.' Males also give a growling  "" gugugug "" or more staccato  "" cak-cak-cak "" when confronting rivals or other intruders, including mammals. Females give a quavering cackle or whinny to show interest to advertising males. In aggressive encounters, they give a hiss or chicken-like cluck. Females stay in contact with chicks using a quiet  "" tu "" , sometimes repeated. If separated from her brood, hens give loud, high-pitched  "" skree "" ,  "" kweer-kweer,  "" and "" kwa-kwa "" calls. Male makes very deep hooting."
Sora,Porzana carolina,Rallidae,Gruiformes,22.5,"The most commonly heard call is a descending whinny that lasts 2-3 seconds. The loud and boisterous whinny echoes across wetlands from spring through summer. Males and females whinny to defend their territory and to keep in touch with each other. They also give a 2-noted  "" ker-wee "" or  "" sor-ah "" where the second note rises in pitch, either singly or before giving a descending whinny.  "
Spot-breasted Oriole,Icterus pectoralis,Icteridae,Passeriformes,22.5,"Calls loud and nasal. Song a series of rich, clear, slow whistles."
Spotted Owl,Strix occidentalis,Strigidae,Strigiformes,47.5,"Spotted Owls give up to 13 different hooting, barking, and whistling calls, although only a few are common. The owl's signal call—used by adult males and females to mark and defend territory, and by males delivering food to females—is a series of four hooted notes, with the middle two closest together. The hoots have a deep, pure tone, with females' voices higher than males. To stay in contact, mated pairs also emit a hollow whistling sound that rises in pitch at the end. Fledged young give a similar high-pitched whistle to beg for food. "
Spotted Sandpiper,Actitis macularius,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,19,"When alarmed, Spotted Sandpipers may give a pair of  "" weet "" notes or, if warning chicks, make a metallic  "" spink "" . Walking toward the nest, they make a simple  "" pink "" sound, often three times in a row. The alarm call is similar to the song except rather than a long string of notes, it is in pairs, followed by a brief pause. Spotted Sandpipers also use a courtship song between a mated pair that has a series of soft  "" pip "" s before the standard song. If they are surprised while incubating, they may let out a loud squeal. Spotted Sandpipers use a rapid string of about 10  "" weet "" calls in the same manner as a song, for courtship and to communicate between pairs."
Spotted Towhee,Pipilo maculatus,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,19,"Spotted Towhees make a catlike mew call, a little more than a half-second long. It seems to be used for scolding as well as by perched or foraging birds. Pairs sometimes exchange a soft, lisping call to stay in contact. Spotted Towhees also give a high, thin flight call. Spotted Towhees have a fairly simple song, a drier faster take on the Eastern Towhee's  "" drink-your-tea "" song that often omits the middle section. It lasts about 1.5 seconds. The song starts with one or two (up to eight) short introductory notes and then a fast trill that can sound like a taut rubber band being plucked, or a piece of paper stuck into a fan. Some Spotted Towhee songs have just the trill phrase only."
Sprague's Pipit,Anthus spragueii,Motacillidae,Passeriformes,16,"A rapid, squeaky  "" squick  "" or "" squeet "" . The pleasant song, given in flight (seldom from the ground), is a series of thin, high-pitched, buzzy  "" tzsew  "" notes, each descending and given in a descending, swirling pattern for about 3 seconds. The males hover on fluttering wings above the territory and glide shallowly when singing. The flight display usually lasts about 30 minutes but exceptionally may continue for 3 hours without interruption."
Spruce Grouse,Falcipennis canadensis,Phasianidae,Galliformes,39.75,"Males in conflict sometimes utter low croaking notes but otherwise seldom vocalize. In spring, females perch high in trees to deliver a loud series of nasal clucks called the  "" cantus "" , usually at dawn and dusk, perhaps to mark territory. Females also give calls including a short  "" kuk "" , nasal  "" purr "" , and a sharper version of the latter, sounding like a bark. Chicks in alarm give a high, short  "" seer "" . No song."
Steller's Eider,Polysticta stelleri,Anatidae,Anseriformes,44,"Makes soft, low, guttural calls that sound like growls and barks. Courting males give a murmuring croon, rarely heard, similar to but softer than that of Common Eider. Females in courtship give a soft  "" qua-haaa "" or  "" cooay.  "" Steller's Eiders call less than the larger eider species. "
Steller's Jay,Cyanocitta stelleri,Corvidae,Passeriformes,32,"Steller's Jays give a loud and repeated  "" shook shook shook shook "" call year-round, in flight, while perched, and during aggressive interactions. They also make a variety of guttural sounds and a harsh, nasal sounding growl. Sometimes they mimics birds, mammals, and other sounds in their environment. Researchers have heard them imitating squirrels, Northern Flickers, Northern Goshawks, White-breasted Nuthatches, and mechanical sounds such as water sprinklers. Males and sometimes females sing a quiet series of whistled, gurgled, and, popping sounds that they string together. This song is most frequently heard during courtship. "
Stilt Sandpiper,Calidris himantopus,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,21.5,"A low, clipped  "" rrrit  "" is the most commonly heard call, with a nighthawk-like buzzy  "" bzzzr "" occasionally heard during aggressive encounters. Mostly in flight, males sing a crescendo series of harsh, grating trills that end with a rising, nasal  "" errreee "" flourish."
Summer Tanager,Piranga rubra,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,17,"Both males and females give a dry, clicking  "" pit-ti-tuck "" , adding extra syllables if agitated. During territorial disputes they may give a whining  "" chew "" . Males sing a series of slurred whistles separated by short pauses that can sound quite similar to (but shorter than) American Robin, typically lasting 2-4 seconds."
Surf Scoter,Melanitta perspicillata,Anatidae,Anseriformes,54,"Courting males give a gurgling call, a guttural croaking, and a popping  "" puk-puk "" . Female give a harsh crowlike  "" crahh "" during courtship and when defending ducklings. "
Surfbird,Calidris virgata,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,25,"A sharp  "" pee-weet. ""  "
Swainson's Hawk,Buteo swainsoni,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,52,"Adults make a shrill  "" kreeeeee "" alarm call when perched or in flight, often in response to intruders at the nest. The piercing call lasts 2-3 seconds, fading at the end. The female Swainson's Hawk also gives a shorter, lower-pitched version of the call when the male brings food to the nest. Females give a soft  "" weeee "" call during copulation, and both male and female make a  "" pi-tick, pi-tick "" pursuit call when defending territorial boundaries. "
Swainson's Thrush,Catharus ustulatus,Turdidae,Passeriformes,17.5,"Both sexes emit about a half dozen different one-or-two-note calls, none of which has the flutelike quality of the advertising song. Migrating birds utter a hollow  "" peep "" or note that resembles the call of a spring peeper frog. Intruders or predators in the vicinity of a nest may hear a  "" whit "" —a sharp, single note expressing alarm or the intention to distract. The bird may repeat this note to try to lure a human intruder away from a nest, and it may respond to a human imitation of the sound. Swainson's Thrushes also have a thin, high-pitched, single-note whine similar to that of American Robin. They also make a  "" bink "" like water dropping onto a hard surface, and a single, drawn-out, metallic  "" peeer "" reminiscent of the song of the Varied Thrush, but not as long. The Swainson's Thrush is best known for its distinctive, fluting song, the upward-spiraling melody that breeding males use to defend nests and territory and also probably to attract mates. While this song varies somewhat from one individual bird to the next, its whistling, constantly ascending quality is always recognizable once you've heard it."
Swainson's Warbler,Limnothlypis swainsonii,Parulidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Both sexes give sharp, resonant chips, in quality recalling the call notes of waterthrushes and Prothonotary Warbler. The primary song, sung by males, is a loud, cascading  "" teer, teer, teer, we-tee-widow "" , or similar, often likened to the song of Louisiana Waterthrush. An alternate song, seldom heard, is a jumble of twittering notes, recalling an American Goldfinch's song. Males give this alternate (or 'complex') song in flight or sometimes quietly while foraging."
Swallow-tailed Kite,Elanoides forficatus,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,57,"When disturbed, Swallow-tailed Kites give a loud, squeaky whistle, usually repeated several times. To deter a predator, they may call while circling and attract up to 20 or more other kites to join in on the effort. During courtship they give a long, upward-slurring whistle. "
Swamp Sparrow,Melospiza georgiana,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"The most common call note is a rich, sweet, resonant  "" seet "" , given by both sexes. Males in conflict with other males also utter low, buzzy call notes. Females flushed from the nest might give a series of stuttering chip notes, and pairs sometimes give quiet, sibilant contact calls when apart. In spring and summer, males sing a rich, liquid series of notes all on the same pitch. It's essentially a slow trill, given to attract mates and mark territory. On rare occasions in early spring, a male delivers a flight song composed of halting, jumbled notes followed by its typical trill. Individual sparrows show slight variations in their songs, and there are distinct regional differences among populations' songs as well. "
Tennessee Warbler,Leiothlypis peregrina,Parulidae,Passeriformes,11.5,"Call is a high-pitched, sharp  "" tsip  "" or  "" tit. "" Tennessee Warbler song consists of 3 parts, a rapid succession of high chips that accelerates toward the end:  "" ticka ticka ticka ticka swit swit swit swit sisisisisisisi "" "
Thick-billed Murre,Uria lomvia,Alcidae,Charadriiformes,45,"Low, guttural, nasal calls sounding like croaks or growls. "
Townsend's Solitaire,Myadestes townsendi,Turdidae,Passeriformes,21,"Townsend's Solitaires have 4 types of calls. The most commonly heard is a high-pitched clear ringing note that they give about 30 times per minute. They give this  "" tew "" call year-round to defend their territories. The other 3 types of calls include a harsh note used when defending their territories against other species; a single, low-pitched note given during food exchanges; and a harsh raspy alarm call given by breeding solitaires. The song of the Townsend's Solitaire is a complex finchlike or thrasherlike song consisting of short, rich warbles that change abruptly in pitch. Each phrase is strung together in bouts lasting about a minute. Males and females sing throughout the year, but the female's song is softer."
Townsend's Warbler,Setophaga townsendi,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12.35,"Both sexes give a soft  "" chip "" call; fighting males sometimes make a rapid twittering sound, as do females disturbed at the nest. Males sing two song types. The primary song is a buzzy  "" weazy weazy weazy tweea "" with ending notes on a higher pitch. A secondary song can be rendered  "" swee swee swee zee "" and is heard mostly when males 'countersing' (exchange songs) with rivals on the breeding grounds. Males sing occasionally during migration and sometimes in late winter before migration."
Tree Swallow,Tachycineta bicolor,Hirundinidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Mates call to each other with the same chirps and gurgles that also appear in their songs. In addition, Tree Swallows give aggressive chatters, shrieking alarm calls, harsh distress calls, and amorous ticking sounds. Tree Swallow songs are high-pitched and liquid, composed of three sounds—a chirp, a whine, and a gurgle—which they mix and match in a variety of patterns. Both males and females sing."
Tricolored Blackbird,Agelaius tricolor,Icteridae,Passeriformes,21,"Male and female Tricolored Blackbirds give a short high-pitched squeak or a more muted, nasal squeak. They are often silent in flight, but sometimes give a short  "" wuk "" that is lower pitched than a Red-winged Blackbird's flight call. Tricolored Blackbirds sound a little bit like a Red-winged Blackbird that is being squeezed [note: we haven't actually squeezed one to verify this]. Their song is muffled and somewhat buzzy with no clear ringing notes. Both males and females sing, but female song occurs most often around the nest and consists of 3 rapid notes, while males sing from all corners of their territory to defend their space and to attract mates. "
Tricolored Heron,Egretta tricolor,Ardeidae,Pelecaniformes,65,"Male and female Tricolored Herons give a quivering, scratchy, nasal call. During aggressive interactions or when flushed they give a short guttural call.  "
Tropical Kingbird,Tyrannus melancholicus,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,20.5,"The most commonly heard call is a high, thin twitter given by both sexes, often when they reunite at the nest site or attack an intruder in the territory. In the hours before sunrise, males sing a stuttering, syncopated series of high trills and twittering calls,  "" pit prrrrr pit pit prrrr.  "" This song is delivered year-round in some places, often from a concealed perch. It is simpler, less raspy and more even in pitch than the song of the very similar-looking Couch's Kingbird."
Trumpeter Swan,Cygnus buccinator,Anatidae,Anseriformes,148,"Male and female Trumpeter Swans give the characteristic deep, trumpeting 'oh-OH' call, with the second syllable emphasized. The call is softer and more nasal-sounding when made with the mouth closed. Trumpeter Swans call to keep the pair or family together, to defend territories, or to sound an alarm. Both sexes also use a flat-toned, single-syllable 'hoo' call to locate each other. Younger swans make a higher-pitched call, and develop their adult tone by the time they're 6-8 months old. "
Tufted Puffin,Fratercula cirrhata,Alcidae,Charadriiformes,38,"A low, growling  "" errrr. ""  "
Tufted Titmouse,Baeolophus bicolor,Paridae,Passeriformes,15,"Titmouse calls are nasal and mechanical. A scratchy, chickadee-like  "" tsee-day-day-day "" is the most common. Tufted Titmice also give fussy, scolding call notes and, when predators are sighted, a harsh distress call that warns other titmice of the danger. The Tufted Titmouse's song is a fast-repeated, clear whistle:  "" peter-peter-peter "" . The birds repeat this up to 11 times in succession or up to 35 songs delivered per minute. Females occasionally sing a quieter version of the song."
Tundra Swan,Cygnus columbianus,Anatidae,Anseriformes,133.5,"Male and female Tundra Swans make a variety of bugling calls that are smoother and higher pitched than those of the Trumpeter Swan. These include a  "" kuk-kuk "" contact call between parents and cygnets; a 1- or 2-syllable  "" ou "" or  "" oh "" used in flight, when flock members change, or when the flock gathers before dusk to roost; and an  "" oo-ou-oo "" call, emphasizing the second syllable. This last call tends to be given when members of a pair reunite, after they land, and during or after an encounter with an opponent, as the birds shake their partially extended wings. In aggressive or defensive situations the adults make a hissing sound. "
Turkey Vulture,Cathartes aura,Cathartidae,Cathartiformes,72.5,"Turkey Vultures lack the vocal organs to make proper songs. Most of their vocalizations come down to a form of low, guttural hiss made when they are irritated or vying for a better spot on a carcass. They also may give a low, nasal whine while in flight. "
Upland Sandpiper,Bartramia longicauda,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,30,"The most commonly heard calls are rapid, fluttering series of three or more  "" tu "" or  "" pip "" notes, all on the same pitch, given by birds in flight, in contact, or under stress. Displaying males sing a somber, trilling whistle that first ascends in pitch, then descends in a pure tone, often called a 'wolf whistle' but having an ethereal musical quality. Males often sing at night, and females also sing on occasion."
Varied Bunting,Passerina versicolor,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"A flat  "" spit  "" is the most commonly heard call from perched birds, while flying birds give very short, buzzy calls that sound similar to the flight call of Indigo Bunting. Males sing a song that can recall a Painted Bunting or Blue Grosbeak (or sometimes House Finch): a jumbled series of variably sweet and scratchy notes that rises and falls pleasantly."
Varied Thrush,Ixoreus naevius,Turdidae,Passeriformes,22.5,"Both males and females make a variety of calls, usually in aggression or defense. Those calls include a short trill, a harsh  "" churrr "" , and a series of low  "" chect "" notes. Male Varied Thrushes sing a whistled, flutelike, sometimes burry tone on a single pitch. They sing mainly in the morning and evening, usually from the top of live conifers. Each song lasts about 2 seconds and is followed by a pause of 3-20 seconds. Successive tones may be on different pitches. This cycle is repeated for 10-15 minutes, until the bird flies to a new perch and starts again."
Vaux's Swift,Chaetura vauxi,Apodidae,Caprimulgiformes,11,"A high-pitched twittering similar to Chimney Swift but higher in pitch, more rapid and insectlike. "
Veery,Catharus fuscescens,Turdidae,Passeriformes,17.5,"Veeries emit a variety of whistled, squealed, and chattering calls. The most common is a distinctive, abrupt  "" veer "" or  "" jeer "" note that can make these birds easy to find even when they are not singing. The name 'Veery' was inspired by the song that males use to defend territory. A series of variations on  "" veer "" , the song descends slightly in pitch, and resonates as if whirling around inside a metal pipe. A group of nineteenth-century observers called it 'an inexpressibly delicate metallic utterance…accompanied by a fine trill which renders it truly seductive.'"
Verdin,Auriparus flaviceps,Remizidae,Passeriformes,10,"Both sexes give a rather loud  "" chip "" call, sometimes in rapid staccato series. Mated pairs give a softer, sweeter  "" see-lip "" or musical  "" tweedle. "" Males sing a simple 2-3 note whistled song,  "" tseet-tsor-tsor "" ."
Vermilion Flycatcher,Pyrocephalus rubinus,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,13.05,"A sharp, squeaky  "" pisk pisk "" . Adults also chatter to each other in a vocalization that is described as similar to the song, but slower. The common song of the Vermilion Flycatcher, given exclusively by the male, is a chirpy, accelerating  "" p-p-p-pik-zee,  "" often repeated several times."
Vesper Sparrow,Pooecetes gramineus,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,14.5,"Call notes include a sharp  "" chirp "" . Their song starts with 1-4 downslurred whistles followed by a rising and falling trill that ends with a buzzy jumble. Vesper Sparrows are early morning songsters, but they also tend to sing after sunset. They sing from elevated perches such as fences, wires, posts, and shrubs. "
Violet-green Swallow,Tachycineta thalassina,Hirundinidae,Passeriformes,12,"Their calls are the most frequently heard sounds. In flight they give a short  "" chee-chee "" , which they often string together for several seconds as they interact with other swallows. They twitter during courtship and territory establishment or in combination with other calls. When defending the nest site, they sometimes give a sharp  "" zwark "" . Although the Violet-green Swallow is a member of the songbird group, its song is a simple series of chirps and is only heard during the pre-dawn hours."
Virginia Rail,Rallus limicola,Rallidae,Gruiformes,23.5,"A long sequence of piglike grunts that tends to trail off at the end emanates from many a wetland in spring. Males and females perform duetting grunts to defend their territories and to communicate with each other throughout the breeding season.  Virginia Rails are particularly vocal in the spring. The birds give a repeated  "" tick-it "" in the hours surrounding dawn and dusk; this vocalization is thought to be made only by males. Females and males also sing a  "" kick-er "" that has a stuttering quality to it."
Virginia's Warbler,Leiothlypis virginiae,Parulidae,Passeriformes,11.2,"The call of the Virginia's Warbler is a high-pitched, flat  "" tic "" or  "" chip "" .  Male Virginia's Warblers sing a sweet and clear warble that gets faster at the end. The song consists of 2 parts; the first part is slow and clear with each note almost countable and the second part is fast and a bit slurred. Males start singing when they arrive at the breeding grounds. They sing more softly as the breeding season progresses and eventually stop singing by mid-July."
Wandering Tattler,Tringa incana,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,28,"Call a loud, ringing  "" kree-kree-kree. ""  "
Warbling Vireo,Vireo gilvus,Vireonidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"Warbling Vireos use many calls, particularly a raspy, descending scold call as well as a low spitting note. Female have a courtship call that they sometimes give in a loose duet with the male. Male Warbling Vireos sing a rapid, undulating, highly variable song with a rich, burbling quality lasting about 3 seconds. The song usually concludes with an accented note pitched higher than the preceding melody. Males sometimes sing from the nest."
Western Bluebird,Sialia mexicana,Turdidae,Passeriformes,17.5,"The most common call is a soft, quavering  "" kew "" that may be given from a perch or in flight and is often given several times in succession. They also make a harsher, double-noted  "" che-check "" when changing position, and a chattering call when disturbed. Western Bluebird songs tend to be a string of various call notes, particularly the  "" kew "" note along with other stuttering or whistled notes. The result is a soft, hesitant song that can last 1-2 seconds."
Western Grebe,Aechmophorus occidentalis,Podicipedidae,Podicipediformes,65,"Western Grebes produce many vocalizations during the breeding season but are largely silent in winter. The advertising call, which commences the rushing ceremony, is a harsh, rolling  "" cree creet "" , which is followed by a ratchet-call, a harsh trill given during the next portion of that ceremony. Females soliciting food from mates give a repeated  "" tuk-a "" , and males give a loud trill during copulation. Other trilling calls are produced during the weed ceremony and lesser displays. Both sexes deliver a  "" tuk-tuk-tuk "" , a threat call directed at rivals during establishment of the nest site. "
Western Gull,Larus occidentalis,Laridae,Charadriiformes,61,"Call a loud whistly  "" keow. ""  "
Western Kingbird,Tyrannus verticalis,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,22,"Western Kingbirds give sharp  "" kip "" notes and squeaky twitters. The male gives a harsh, buzzing call when attacking predators or other kingbirds. Though it's not technically in the group of birds known as songbirds, the Western Kingbird has one call that functions as a song. Starting just before sunrise, breeding males perch on tree limbs or wires and give a rising series of sharp  "" kips "" , culminating in a frantic burst of loud descending notes. Each call lasts about 2 seconds, and the male may repeat the pattern for half an hour to proclaim his territory."
Western Meadowlark,Sturnella neglecta,Icteridae,Passeriformes,21,"The Western Meadowlark's most common call is a low, bell-like  "" pluk "" or  "" chupp "" which they use when disturbed and during courtship and territorial displays. Female Western Meadowlarks also give a soft rattle during courtship and egg laying, as well as a low intensity  "" tee-tee-tee "" when building the nest and laying eggs. For their first few weeks after leaving the nest, young birds give a simple, high-pitched location call, which is replaced by a  "" weet "" note once the birds are independent. Adults use the  "" weet "" note when migrating. Male Western Meadowlarks have a complex, two-phrase 'primary' song that begins with 1-6 pure whistles and descends to a series of 1-5 gurgling warbles. Males develop a repertoire of up to a dozen songs, and may switch the songs they sing in response to an intruder. When chasing competing males or responsive females, male Western Meadowlarks give a hurried, excited 'flight song' of short-spaced whistles and warbles. Although Western Meadowlarks seldom sing more than 10-12 songs, their eastern counterparts exhibit a much larger repertoire of 50-100 song variations."
Western Sandpiper,Calidris mauri,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,15.5,"A harsh  "" jeet  "" is the most commonly heard call, usually from flying or feeding birds. They make various distress, alarm, and contact calls mostly on the breeding grounds. Displaying males sing a brief song that begins with a high, thin, rising  "" te-e-e-e-e ""  "" tweer-tweer-tweer  "" and closes with a falling, buzzy trill."
Western Screech-Owl,Megascops kennicottii,Strigidae,Strigiformes,22,"To stay in contact, pairs of screech-owls use a short  "" double trill ""  call; when agitated, they make a barking sound. Adult females whinny in response to the male's bouncing ball song, and to solicit feeding and copulation. Heard at dusk and into the night, the Western Screech-Owl's most distinctive vocalization is its  "" bouncing ball ""  song: a series of 5-9 short, whistled hoots, speeding up ping-pong-ball fashion toward the end. The male uses this for territorial and courtship advertising, often calling from a nest tree or a prospective nest site. In duets sung by a mating pair, the female's notes are interspersed with the male's—her voice higher than her mate's, despite her larger size. "
Western Tanager,Piranga ludoviciana,Cardinalidae,Passeriformes,17.5,"The most common call of the Western Tanager is a short, 2-3 note chuckling or rattling call, similar to a Summer Tanager's call. Male Western Tanagers sing a short, rasping song that lasts about 2.5 seconds and consists of a few short, burry up-and-down phrases, sometimes likened to the bird asking and answering a series of rapid-fire questions. The song is reminiscent of an American Robin's song but usually shorter and hoarser or raspier in tone."
Western Wood-Pewee,Contopus sordidulus,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,15,"Males and females give a burry  "" bzew "" when communicating with their mates or when defending their nests. The call has a similar quality to the  "" pee-wee "" song but it has only one syllable. They repeat this call every 0.5-2 seconds. Western Wood-Pewees sing a burry and nasal sounding version of their own name,  "" pee-wee "" or  "" pee-er "" . This song is sung from an exposed perch and is heard throughout the day on the breeding grounds and during migration. At dawn males sing a long  "" peee "" followed by two short  "" pip pip "" notes, with a bit of the  "" pee-wee "" song thrown in as well. Their song is much burrier and shorter than the <a href= "" /guide/Eastern_Wood-Pewee/sounds "" >Eastern Wood-Pewee's song</a>."
Whimbrel,Numenius phaeopus,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,44.5,"Flying Whimbrels often give a series of mellow, piping whistles, all on the same pitch, very similar to other curlews, and a soft, whistled  "" cur-lee "" . Birds in courtship or conflict (or simply in contact) on the breeding grounds also deliver a more whining or screaming whistle,  "" wee-ee.  "" Many other low whistles and trills are also heard on the breeding grounds. Males in aerial display deliver a song comprised of staccato, sputtering rising whistles<strong>.</strong>"
White Ibis,Eudocimus albus,Threskiornithidae,Pelecaniformes,62,"Their call is a rather unmusical, harsh and nasal honk given in flight or while foraging. "
White-breasted Nuthatch,Sitta carolinensis,Sittidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"The White-breasted Nuthatch's most common call is a loud, nasal  "" yank "" often repeated a few times in a row. Both sexes make this call, and it often has a more trembling, almost bleating quality, than either the bird's song or the Red-breasted Nuthatch's call. When looking for food, males and females exchange a soft  "" yink "" . Male White-breasted Nuthatches sing in late winter and spring, a rapid, nasal, fairly low-pitched  "" wha-wha-wha "" that lasts 2-3 seconds. It's made up of a half-dozen to a dozen nearly identical notes. Males sing these songs at two rates, with the faster version packing in twice as many notes in the same amount of time. The fast version is thought to be the main one used for mate attraction."
White-crowned Pigeon,Patagioenas leucocephala,Columbidae,Columbiformes,34,"Call is a gruff, three-part growl. Song is a repeated  "" coo. ""  "
White-crowned Sparrow,Zonotrichia leucophrys,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,15.5,"White-crowned Sparrows have about 10 different calls. The most frequently heard include a sharp  "" pink "" , lower-pitched than the White-throated Sparrow's call. It's usually made by males or as an alarm call near the nest. They also make a harsh, rasping call used by sparrows during altercations. The song of the White-crowned Sparrow Is one of the most-studied sounds in all of animal behavior. Different subspecies across the country sing clearly different songs, but they're all recognizable by the sweet, whistling introduction, a succession of jumbled whistles, and a buzz or trill near the end. Songs last 2-3 seconds. Females sing only rarely."
White-eyed Vireo,Vireo griseus,Vireonidae,Passeriformes,12,"Their calls include a short  "" zip  "" and a harsh, nasal  "" mew "" that sounds a bit like a Blue-gray Gnatcatcher. The White-eyed Vireo's song is rapid, harsh, and nasal with sharp chips at beginning and end. They sing several different series of notes, repeating each series multiple times before switching to a new series. They even mimic the sounds of other birds, often sounding like a Gray Catbird. Some suggest that they sing  "" Spit "" .  "" And see if I care "" .  "" Spit "" . while others suggest they sing  "" Pik-chicka-weew "" . They sing at all hours of the day, but tend to sing more frequently at dawn and dusk. Males and females sing on the wintering grounds, but only males have been observed singing on the breeding grounds. "
White-faced Ibis,Plegadis chihi,Threskiornithidae,Pelecaniformes,51,"Nasal moaning  "" urm. ""  Croaks and rattles at breeding colony. "
White-headed Woodpecker,Dryobates albolarvatus,Picidae,Piciformes,22,"A high-pitched, sharp, very rapid  "" pee "" - "" kik "" or  "" pee "" - "" kik-kik  "" is the most commonly heard call, with longer rattling calls sounding similar but longer. "
White-rumped Sandpiper,Calidris fuscicollis,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,16.5,"A very high-pitched, electric-sounding  "" tzeet  "" often likened to a mouse squeak. Males sing a bizarre, mechanical-sounding, insectlike song, which alternates rapidly between a wiry buzzing sound and a low, guttural or snoring sound."
White-tailed Hawk,Geranoaetus albicaudatus,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,49,"Adults give a scratchy, high-pitched call that begins with a rising whine followed by a series of two-parted notes. Begging juveniles give a nasal, whistled  "" peeeeee-up "" . "
White-tailed Kite,Elanus leucurus,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,35,"White-tailed Kites give a quiet whistled  "" yelp "" year-round. "
White-tailed Ptarmigan,Lagopus leucura,Phasianidae,Galliformes,30.5,"White-tailed Ptarmigan are most vocal during the nesting season. Both sexes produce a series of nasal clucks and growls. No song in the conventional sense, but males often deliver a so-called  "" flight scream, ""  a short series of high, screeching clucks, given during aerial displays over territory."
White-throated Sparrow,Zonotrichia albicollis,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,17,"The main call of the White-throated Sparrow is a sharp, explosive,  "" chink "" , often given by an agitated bird with crown feathers raised, flicking its tail. It's an alarm call often given near a nest or when a predator or other threat has been spotted. A two-parted  "" chip-up "" is a sign of aggression between two birds or given when adults arrive at the nest. White-throated Sparrows also make a trill that can be up to 2 seconds long. Females do this as part of courtship; males sometimes use trills to signal aggression as they push their head forward and flutter their wings. Flock members make a high, level  "" seep "" . White-throated Sparrows sing a pretty, thin whistle that sounds like  "" Oh-sweet-canada-canada "" or  "" Old-Sam-Peabody-Peabody "" . The whistles are even but typically move slightly up or down in pitch by the second or third note. The whole song lasts about 4 seconds. White-throated Sparrows sing often during the breeding season, even in the middle of the day, and on their winter range as well. Males of both forms sing, and so does the 'white-striped' female. 'Tan-striped' females sing very rarely."
White-throated Swift,Aeronautes saxatalis,Apodidae,Caprimulgiformes,16.5,"A harsh, rattling  "" screeee "" given in flight is the most commonly heard call, but single- and double-noted calls are also occasionally heard. "
White-tipped Dove,Leptotila verreauxi,Columbidae,Columbiformes,28,"Both sexes give cooing calls at the nest. Song is a low-pitched  "" wo-woo-ooo "" , like the sound of someone blowing across the mouth of an empty bottle. Males in courtship display give a more guttural cooing sound, and females respond with cooing notes."
White-winged Crossbill,Loxia leucoptera,Fringillidae,Passeriformes,16,"The commonly heard call from perched and flying birds is a rapid   "" chut-chut-chut-chut "" similar to flight calls of redpolls. Both males and females sing a series of trills interspersed with rattles, chirps, and warbles; males sing more frequently and vigorously than females."
White-winged Dove,Zenaida asiatica,Columbidae,Columbiformes,NA,"Females make a shorter, softer, more slurred call. Both males and females will give a short call from the nest when they hear other White-winged Doves nearby. Males make a series of about nine scratchy, hooting coos that alternate between a few slurred pitches, lasting 5-6 seconds; the final coo is often longer than the rest. They sing from a high perch in an open area."
White-winged Scoter,Melanitta deglandi,Anatidae,Anseriformes,53,"Silent at sea except during the most vigorous courtship displays, when both sexes give a high-pitched, piping whistle. Females in distress utter a low, gravelly  "" kaak-kaak-kaak "" . "
Whooping Crane,Grus americana,Gruidae,Gruiformes,150,"When startled, Whooping Cranes give a loud, single-note bugle call lasting less than one second. They call in unison when courting. While feeding they give a frequent low purr to keep in contact with each other. "
Wild Turkey,Meleagris gallopavo,Phasianidae,Galliformes,112.5,"Male turkeys are called 'gobblers' because of their famous call, which is their version of a rooster's crow. It's a loud, shrill, descending, throaty jumble of sound that lasts about 1 second. Males often gobble from their treetop roosts, where the sound carries better than on the ground. They use it to attract females and in response to other males—sometimes one male's call can lead to a group of others joining in. Both males and females cackle as they fly down from roosts, give very short, soft purring calls while traveling on foot, and give a long series of yelps to reassemble a flock after it has become scattered. Young turkeys whistle three or four times to their flockmates when they're lost. "
Willet,Tringa semipalmata,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,37,"When chicks are present, Willets respond to predators with a single-note staccato  "" kleep, "" and high-pitched alarm calls, and take up sentry posts atop tall trees to warn of threats. They make a  "" kyah-yah "" call when crossing another's territory or as a way to maintain contact during migratory flights and when shuttling between foraging and breeding areas. When approached, Willets may react with high-pitched, agitated  "" kip-kip-kip, ""  "" wiek "" , and  "" kreeliii "" alarm calls. In springtime, the Willet's signature  "" pill-will-willet "" call rings out over its breeding territory in the morning and evening, with competing males calling throughout the day. Eastern Willets give a slightly higher-pitched, more rapidly repeated version of the song than Western birds."
Williamson's Sapsucker,Sphyrapicus thyroideus,Picidae,Piciformes,23,"A high, nasal  "" chyaah "" that sounds like a raptor is the most often heard call. Pairs also give a staccato chatter and a rattling trill during nesting season. "
Willow Flycatcher,Empidonax traillii,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,15,"Willow Flycatchers call with a soft, dry  "" whit "" . Flycatcher songs are often the key to their identity and this one sings a hoarse  "" fitz-bew "" from high perches in their territory. They also sing a burry zip, which sounds similar to someone quickly zipping up a jacket. Each song lasts for less than 1 second, but they repeat each one over and over. Males do most of the singing, but females also sing on occasion, though their songs tend to be quieter."
Willow Ptarmigan,Lagopus lagopus,Phasianidae,Galliformes,39.25,"Willow Ptarmigan are very vocal during the nesting season and have a remarkable repertoire of call types, many of which sound comical, even humanlike. Both male and female produce a series of nasal clucks and growls in many contexts, ranging from contact with mates, conflict with rivals, or the presence of predators. Still other calls sound like a scream, hiss, purr, or peep. Males are highly vocal during courtship and territorial defense, when they often deliver what some refer to as 'flight song,' a rollicking, guttural series of clucks."
Wilson's Phalarope,Phalaropus tricolor,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,23,"Both sexes make a short, nasal call both during courtship and as a way of staying in contact.  Females make a series of low, hollow notes for communication over longer distances. At close range they can also make a quiet purring or a low, somewhat froglike call. Birds at migration roosts make soft gurgling calls. "
Wilson's Plover,Charadrius wilsonia,Charadriidae,Charadriiformes,18,"A clipped  "" peet  "" and a rich, slurred  "" tweet "" are the most commonly heard calls. They also give rattling calls when chasing intruders in the territory and a dovelike mooing call when courting. "
Wilson's Snipe,Gallinago delicata,Scolopacidae,Charadriiformes,29.5,"Both male and female Wilson's Snipes give an array of calls on the breeding grounds. They also make a  "" scaipe "" call when they flush or at night during migration. Breeding birds give a repeated hard, sharp  "" jick "" call when excited, a  "" chip-per "" call between males and females, and a harsher chip that the male makes when landing to court a female, or the female makes as a male winnows overhead. "
Wilson's Warbler,Cardellina pusilla,Parulidae,Passeriformes,11,"Like other warblers, male and female Wilson's Warblers give a single chip note to communicate with mates and young and to notify territory intruders. The chip sounds similar to someone giving a loud puckering kiss. The song of the Wilson's Warbler is simple with a sweet quality. Their fast, slightly accelerating song is a string of similar notes, dropping downward in pitch toward the end, that ring loud and clear even next to noisy streams. Males sing for about 2 seconds, pause for several seconds and burst into song again, singing around 5 songs per minute. Unlike other warblers, females also occasionally sing. Males start singing just before they leave the wintering grounds and continue to sing throughout migration and on the breeding grounds. Once they start nesting, they sing less frequently."
Winter Wren,Troglodytes hiemalis,Troglodytidae,Passeriformes,10,"Winter Wrens give a call similar to the barking call of a Song Sparrow, a rather squeaky  "" klip "" . Male and female both call, sometimes repeating the notes depending on how agitated they are. Male Winter Wrens sing a cascading, bubbly song that lasts about 5-10 seconds. Each song is made up of dozens of bell-like notes that they combine and change up from time to time. Males sing from elevated perches especially early in the season when they are establishing territories and while they are building the nest. Their songs are somewhat slower and their notes are slightly more distinct than their western counterpart, the Pacific Wren."
Wood Duck,Aix sponsa,Anatidae,Anseriformes,50.5,"Female makes loud  "" oo-eek, oo-eek ""  when disturbed and taking flight. Male has thin, rising and falling zeeting whistle. "
Wood Stork,Mycteria americana,Ciconiidae,Ciconiiformes,100,"Wood Storks are usually silent, but nestlings make a ruckus at the breeding colonies. Nestlings make a loud nasal sound, a bit like a braying donkey.  "
Wood Thrush,Hylocichla mustelina,Turdidae,Passeriformes,20,"A staccato  "" bup-bup-bup "" call signals mild distress, but rises in pitch and grows louder and more complex with increasing agitation until it becomes a distinctive, machine-gun-like  "" pit-pit-pit "" alarm. This call accompanies territory or nest defense. The male sometimes chatters a  "" pit-pit "" call during nest building, when it may be part of mate guarding. The Wood Thrush's easily recognized, flute-like  "" ee-oh-lay ""  is actually only the middle phrase of a three-part song. It learns the phrase from other Wood Thrushes and sings several variants with 2 to 10 loud, clear notes. Combining those with 1-3 variants of the low, soft notes of the introductory phrase and 6-12 variants of the final higher-pitched complex trill, a male can easily sing over 50 distinct songs. Individuals can be identified by the repeating order they sing their variants of the middle phrase in song after song."
Woodhouse's Scrub-Jay,Aphelocoma woodhouseii,Corvidae,Passeriformes,29,"Woodhouse's Scrub-Jays are extremely vocal. Behaviorists have described more than 20 separate types of calls for this and the closely related California Scrub-Jay. Examples include a  "" weep "" uttered during flight, while carrying nesting material, or while taking cover from a flying predator; a bell-like  "" shlenk "" used antagonistically, a quiet  "" kuk "" exchanged between mates, and loud, rasping scolds for mobbing predators. Both males and females sing a soft medley of sweet notes that can last up to 5 minutes. Scrub-jays typically do this only during courtship and when the pair is close together."
Worm-eating Warbler,Helmitheros vermivorum,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12.149999999999999," Song a rapid, dry trill, often insect-like."
Wrentit,Chamaea fasciata,Sylviidae,Passeriformes,14.5,"Wrentits give a churring call which sounds similar to someone rolling their r's. Wrentits give louder more emphatic calls when scolding a predator or intruder. Wrentits sing a distinctive song reminiscent of a ball bouncing that lasts for about 4 seconds. In males this starts out as 3 to 5  "" pits "" followed by an accelerating trill; the ball bounces away. Females also sing but they catch the ball and sing only 3 to 14  "" pits "" without the accelerating trill. Both sexes sing at all hours of the day, all year long, although they are more vocal within the first hour after sunrise and early in the breeding season."
Yellow Rail,Coturnicops noveboracensis,Rallidae,Gruiformes,15.5,"Nesting birds sometimes give cackles, squeaks, moans, whines, clunks, and wheezes. Males deliver an insectlike series of clicks, usually in series of two followed by three (then repeated in the same pattern, for long periods). The sound may be imitated by tapping two small, smooth rocks together. Usually sings at night."
Yellow Warbler,Setophaga petechia,Parulidae,Passeriformes,12.5,"Yellow Warblers use a variety of short chip notes, some with a metallic sound and some with a lisping or buzzing quality. Males sometimes alternate chip notes with their songs, and females may answer a song with a high-pitched chip. Both sexes use a high, hissing note in territorial defense, and may confront cowbirds with a  "" seet "" call. Males sing a sweet series of 6-10 whistled notes that accelerate over the course of the roughly 1-second song and often end on a rising note. The tone is so sweet that people often remember it with the mnemonic  "" sweet sweet sweet I'm so sweet "" . The songs are a common sound of spring and early summer mornings and may be repeated as often as 10 times per minute."
Yellow-bellied Flycatcher,Empidonax flaviventris,Tyrannidae,Passeriformes,14,"Males and females give a rising whistled  "" tu-wee "" reminiscent of an Eastern Wood-Pewee. Yellow-bellied Flycatchers sing an abrupt, hoarse  "" che-lek "" or  "" che-bunk "" , throwing their head back with every note. Unmated males repeat their short song from high perches, but mated males tend to also sing while foraging in the understory. As the breeding season progresses they sing less frequently."
Yellow-bellied Sapsucker,Sphyrapicus varius,Picidae,Piciformes,20,"The Yellow-bellied Sapsucker's signature call is a scratchy, nasal mewing that is often repeated. They also have a squealing call, a repeated  "" quee-ah, quee-ah "" , that's territorial and often heard in breeding season. And they make a  "" waa "" call when disturbed or to alert others to danger. "
Yellow-billed Cuckoo,Coccyzus americanus,Cuculidae,Cuculiformes,28,"Male Yellow-Billed Cuckoos make a distinctive series of hollow, wooden-sounding  "" ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-kow-kow-kowlp-kowlp-kowlp-kowlp "" syllables. The whole series is quite slow and gets slower toward the end; calls can last up to about 8 seconds. Both members of nesting pairs give a metallic, rattling call, and a series of  "" kow-kow-kow "" notes that sounds like a metal door knocker hitting a strike plate. Males and females also make a soft, repeated cooing: unmated males give this song to attract females, and females coo during courtship. "
Yellow-billed Magpie,Pica nuttalli,Corvidae,Passeriformes,48.5,"Both sexes give a similar rapid-fire set of harsh calls, very similar to Black-billed Magpie. No song, though courting males deliver a bubbly, warbling set of calls often termed 'babble-song.'"
Yellow-breasted Chat,Icteria virens,Icteriidae,Passeriformes,18,"They have a variety of calls, including a distinctive harsh scolding. Females also make a gargling growl when disturbed at the nest. Wintering males and females give a 'chuck' call to defend winter territories. Males have a large repertoire of songs made up of whistles, cackles, mews, catcalls, caw notes, chuckles, rattles, squawks, gurgles, and pops, which they repeat and string together with great variety. Songs of Western birds may be higher in pitch and more rapid than those of eastern birds. They sing in morning and evening (and even at night during the height of the breeding season), either concealed in thickets or exposed on prominent perches within their breeding territories."
Yellow-crowned Night-Heron,Nyctanassa violacea,Ardeidae,Pelecaniformes,62.5,"Yellow-crowned Night-Herons give a harsh squawk that may be repeated a few times per second. They call when disturbed, and also have call variations specific to the breeding season. "
Yellow-eyed Junco,Junco phaeonotus,Passerellidae,Passeriformes,15,"Yellow-eyed Juncos give a metallic chip and a high-pitched  "" seep "" year-round. In winter, flocks give a quiet twitter with their bills closed. Males sing a 2-3 parted trill from high perches in conifer trees during the breeding season. The song is a fast trill that starts with clear, evenly pitched notes followed by more of a slurred or buzzy trill.  "
Yellow-headed Blackbird,Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus,Icteridae,Passeriformes,23.5,"Their calls include frequent  "" check "" calls used in many situations during the breeding season, screams given by alarmed females, growls given by fighting or mating males, and harsh rattles given by males when predators are about. Males sing a few musical notes followed by a screeching buzz, rather like a heavy door swinging on a very rusty metal hinge. They sing from cattails, bulrushes, fences, shrubs, or small trees in the morning and evening during the breeding season. Females make a chattering sound that may be considered a song."
Yellow-rumped Warbler,Setophaga coronata,Parulidae,Passeriformes,13,"Yellow-rumped Warblers have two main calls. The more common one, a sharp  "" chek "" , differs between the myrtle and Audubon's races. Both forms are quite recognizable and are a key call to learn for a bird watcher hoping to start sorting out migrating warblers in fall. Both sexes make this call frequently, both while foraging and while flying. Yellow-rumped Warblers also make a soft  "" psit "" and a high  "" tsee "" in flight. Males sing a slow, soft, sweetly whistled warble or trill. The pitch is mostly even but may rise or fall slightly, speeding up as it ends. Songs last 1-3 seconds and consist of up to 21 individual notes."
Yellow-throated Vireo,Vireo flavifrons,Vireonidae,Passeriformes,14,"Males and females make a harsh, scolding chatter during aggressive encounters with other vireos, birds, or predators. The intensity of the scold increases with the level of threat.    Yellow-throated Vireos sing a broken series of burry 2- and 3-syllable phrases as if saying  "" three eight "" . Between bursts of  "" three eight "" they pause for a second or longer. In his  "" Essential Field Guide Companion "" , Pete Dunne describes the song as a vireo with a sore throat. Males sing from the canopy starting during migration and throughout the breeding season, though the intensity of song decreases after obtaining a mate. Red-Eyed Vireos sound similar but lack the burry quality of Yellow-throated Vireos."
Yellow-throated Warbler,Setophaga dominica,Parulidae,Passeriformes,13.5,"Males and female give a loud, sharp  "" chip "" . Males sing a series of clear notes that roll into each other, dropping slightly in pitch, but sometimes ending with one higher-pitched note. They typically sing from perches in the canopy. "
Zone-tailed Hawk,Buteo albonotatus,Accipitridae,Accipitriformes,50.5,"A high-pitched, screaming  "" kreeee "" or  "" kreeee-ah "" , similar to call of Red-tailed Hawk. Many other short, yapping calls during the nesting season. "
